# Zipvilization

Zipvilization is an on-chain civilization experiment.

It explores whether an immutable contract, a fixed token supply, and a
non-negotiable set of rules can give rise to a coherent system of territory,
participation, and economic behavior without centralized control.

This repository documents the system as it is defined and observed,
not as it is promoted.

---

## System definition

Zipvilization is defined by:
- An immutable on-chain contract (Solum)
- Rules that do not adapt to user behavior
- Participation without predefined objectives or outcome optimization
- Observation and interpretation instead of intervention

The system does not attempt to guide, reward, or correct participant behavior
during its initial stages. It records and exposes what emerges under fixed
constraints.

---

## What Zipvilization is (current scope)

At its current stage, Zipvilization is:
- A rule-based on-chain system
- An experiment in emergence under constraint
- A territory-based interpretation of a token
- A framework designed to be observed before being expanded

The initial chapters focus on establishing the foundations of the system
and validating that it can exist coherently under immutable rules.

---

## What Zipvilization is not (at this stage)

At this stage, Zipvilization is not:
- An investment product
- A game with objectives or progression mechanics
- A governance or voting system
- A promise of utility, returns, or guaranteed outcomes

These exclusions describe the current state of the project, not its
theoretical limits.

---

## Evolution beyond the initial chapters

After the foundational chapters are established, Zipvilization is intended
to explore its full potential as a system.

Future exploration may include:
- Additional interpretation and representation layers
- New forms of interaction with the system state
- Ways to reinvest available resources into the evolution of the system
- Mechanisms designed to improve the overall Zipvilization experience
  for participants (“colonists”)

These directions are exploratory by nature. They are not commitments,
timelines, or guarantees, and will only be pursued if they remain coherent
with the system’s constraints and principles.

---

## Repository scope

This repository is the technical and conceptual reference for Zipvilization.

It contains:
- Definitions of system rules and constraints
- Documentation of the Solum contract
- Descriptions of interpretation layers (e.g. Solumtools)
- Structural chapters outlining possible evolution stages

Only elements that reflect verifiable system behavior or explicitly defined
concepts are documented here.

---

## System layers (overview)

- **On-chain layer**  
  The Solum contract and its immutable rules.

- **Interpretation layer**  
  Read-only tools that translate on-chain data into system state
  (e.g. Solumtools).

- **Representation layers**  
  Additional layers that may visualize or contextualize the system.
  These layers are documented as conceptual unless explicitly implemented.

---

## Project status

Zipvilization is an active experiment.

Some components described in this repository are implemented.
Others are conceptual and exist to define boundaries and exploration space,
not delivery commitments.

Each document specifies its own scope and current status.
