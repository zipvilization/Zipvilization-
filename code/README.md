# Solum — Code

This directory contains the technical execution of Solum.

It does not define Semina.
It implements deterministic rules and tooling required to:

- read on-chain reality (`indexer/`)
- produce deterministic snapshots (`world/`)
- render reality as SolumMap / SolumWorld views (`map/`)
- share deterministic types and utilities (`shared/`)

Conceptual foundations live under `docs/Solum/`.
This code executes them.
