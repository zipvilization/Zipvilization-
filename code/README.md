# Code Layer

This directory contains the **technical components** of Zipvilization.

Everything here is experimental unless explicitly stated otherwise.

If something is not present in code, it does not exist operationally.

---

## Purpose

The code layer exists to:

- Define immutable rules when required
- Provide technical tooling for observation and interpretation
- Serve as the execution substrate for Zipvilization

It does not exist to:
- Optimize outcomes
- Enforce narratives
- Guarantee behavior
- Protect participants from risk

---

## Current State

At this stage (Chapter 0):

- Some components are **draft**
- Some components are **paused**
- Nothing here should be considered deployed or active unless explicitly marked

This repository reflects **work in progress**, not a live system.

---

## Structure

Typical subdirectories may include:

- `token/`  
  On-chain economic primitives (draft / paused)

- `tools/`  
  Off-chain utilities for data collection or interpretation

- `scripts/`  
  Deployment or testing helpers (non-production)

The presence of code does not imply readiness.

---

## On-Chain Components

Any smart contract present in this directory:

- Is not deployed by default
- Has no authority until deployed
- Is subject to revision, pause, or removal during Chapter 0

No assumptions should be made based solely on code availability.

---

## Testing and Tooling

Testing, CI, and automation may exist in various states of completeness.

They are used internally to:
- Validate assumptions
- Detect inconsistencies
- Explore failure modes

They do not imply guarantees of correctness.

---

## Final Note

Zipvilization is not defined by its code alone.

Code is a necessary component, but not a promise.

If a component becomes canonical, it will be clearly documented as such.

Until then, this directory should be read as:
**experimentation in public, without commitment**.
