# Solum Code — Status (Phase 0)

This directory contains Phase 0 scaffolding for Solum execution.

Included:
- Layer anchors (`indexer/`, `world/`, `map/`, `shared/`)
- Deterministic simulator stubs (`world/`)
- Shared types (`shared/`)
- Contract boundary scaffolding (`shared/contracts/`)

Not included yet (by design):
- Build tooling (Foundry / Hardhat)
- Automated tests
- Deployment scripts
- Tokenomics logic
- Autonomous execution logic

The goal of Phase 0 is to anchor semantics and boundaries,
not to ship production code.
