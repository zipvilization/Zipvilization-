# 🔒 Solum — Immutable Substrate

Solum is the **on-chain substrate** of Zipvilization.

It is not a governance token.
It is not an experimental mechanic.
It is not a promise of yield.

Solum defines **what is possible and what is not** inside the system.

If a rule is not present in the contract, it does not exist.

## 🧱 What Solum Is

At the contract level, **Solum is an ERC-20 token** with fixed supply and immutable rules.

At the Zipvilization level, **Solum represents territory**:

- **1 Solum = 1 square meter of land**
- Total world size: **100 trillion m² (100T Solum)**
- No minting. No inflation. No expansion.

Solum is the **soil** upon which the civilization emerges.

## 🛡️ What Solum Protects

Solum is designed to protect the system during its most fragile phases.

### 1. Fair Access

- **Max Transaction (MAX_TX)**  
  Prevents instant dominance via single large movements.

- **Max Wallet (dynamic)**  
  Starts constrained and grows over time, allowing:
  - early protection
  - long-term expansion

These limits are not permanent walls — they are **temporal safeguards**.

---

### 2. Structural Friction (Taxes)

Solum applies immutable taxes depending on transaction type:

- **Buy**
- **Sell**
- **Transfer**

These taxes are not arbitrary.

They introduce **friction**, which is essential for:
- discouraging extractive behavior
- slowing destructive velocity
- funding long-term development

At the contract level, taxes route value into:
- burn
- liquidity
- reflection
- treasury

Their *meaning* inside Zipvilization is described separately.

---

### 3. Supply Integrity

- **Fixed total supply**
- **Real burn** (supply is permanently reduced)
- No administrative minting
- No emergency inflation

Solum’s scarcity is not narrative — it is enforced.

---

### 4. Launch Discipline

Before trading is enabled:

- Only explicitly exempt addresses can move tokens
- No silent accumulation
- No pre-launch chaos

The moment trading is enabled marks **Day 0** of the system.

## 🔧 Technical Specification

Solum’s full technical behavior is defined here:

➡️ **Contract Specification**  
`docs/solum/CONTRACT_SPEC.md`

This document includes:
- exact limits and constants
- tax breakdowns
- owner powers and constraints
- swapback logic
- treasury mechanics
- edge cases and invariants

If you want to audit Solum, start there.

## 🌍 Solum Inside Zipvilization

Solum is not just a token.

Inside Zipvilization, the same mechanics represent:

- territory
- geography
- time
- evolution
- irreversible change

➡️ **Solum Translation (Zipvilization Context)**  
`docs/zipvilization/SOLUM_TRANSLATION.md`

This document explains:
- why burn becomes forests, rivers, and lakes
- why transfer taxes represent relocation cost
- why treasury growth enables evolution
- why holders are also colonists

---

## 🧭 Final Note

Solum does not try to optimize outcomes.

It defines **constraints**.

Everything that emerges later — tools, worlds, visuals — must operate **within these limits**, not around them.

Solum is not flexible by design.

It is reliable.
