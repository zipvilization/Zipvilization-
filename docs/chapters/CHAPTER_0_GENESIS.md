# 🟢 Chapter 0 — Genesis  
**Existir sin fingir**

---

## What This Chapter Is

Chapter 0 — Genesis is the **foundational state** of Zipvilization.

At this stage, Zipvilization does not attempt to be:
- a world
- a game
- a visualization
- an experience

It attempts only one thing:

> **to exist correctly on-chain**

Genesis establishes the system’s **right to exist** before it earns the right to evolve.

---

## What Exists in Genesis

Genesis is intentionally minimal, but fully real.

The following elements MUST exist and be operational:

- ✅ Solum token deployed on-chain
- ✅ Fixed, explicit, and immutable rules
- ✅ Public liquidity pool
- ✅ Real transactions and holders
- ✅ On-chain observability (raw, unsmoothed)
- ✅ Verifiable supply, burn, and movement

Everything that exists in Genesis is:
- public
- inspectable
- reproducible

Nothing is abstracted or hidden.

---

## What Does NOT Exist Yet

The absence of features is deliberate.

Genesis explicitly does NOT include:

- ❌ World representation
- ❌ Visual layers or maps
- ❌ Narrative interpretation
- ❌ Roles or classifications
- ❌ UX optimization
- ❌ Gamification
- ❌ Promises of future utility

If something is not on-chain, it does not exist.

---

## Purpose of Genesis

Genesis serves one function:

> **prove that the substrate can survive reality**

This includes:
- real users
- real incentives
- real mistakes
- real inactivity
- real edge cases

Genesis is successful if:
- the system remains coherent
- the rules do not require intervention
- nothing needs to be “fixed” by adding layers above

---

## Design Principle

> **If the foundation is unstable, nothing above it is meaningful.**

Genesis prioritizes:
- correctness over growth
- clarity over appeal
- restraint over ambition

No higher chapter may begin until Genesis is considered complete.

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Chapter 0 is considered complete when:

- Solum operates continuously without rule changes
- On-chain activity exists and is observable
- No off-chain logic is required to explain the system
- The project can remain in this state indefinitely without harm

Genesis does not expire.
It becomes invisible only when stronger layers are added above it.

---

## Relationship to Future Chapters

Genesis is the **anchor** for all future evolution.

Every higher chapter must be able to answer:

> “Would this still make sense if Genesis were the only thing that existed?”

If the answer is no, the feature does not belong.

---

## Final Note

Genesis is not exciting by design.

It is calm.  
It is quiet.  
It is honest.

That is its strength.
