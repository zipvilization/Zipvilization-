# 👤 Chapter 3 — Colonists & Roles  
**Cuando el territorio empieza a tener historia**

---

## What This Chapter Is

Chapter 3 introduces **actors**.

The world already exists (Chapter 2).
Now we acknowledge that someone is **inhabiting it**.

From this point onward:
- wallets are not just holders
- balances are not just territory
- actions are not just transfers

They become **colonists with observable footprints**.

---

## Colonists: A Neutral Definition

A **colonist** is any wallet that holds Solum.

Nothing more.
Nothing less.

There is no identity claim.
No off-chain linkage.
No human assumption.

A colonist is defined solely by:
- presence (holding territory)
- time
- activity

---

## Roles Are Not Status

This chapter introduces **roles**, not ranks.

A role:
- describes a behavior
- is derived from verifiable on-chain signals
- can coexist with other roles
- can change over time

Roles are **descriptive**, never prescriptive.

---

## Why Roles Exist

Roles exist to make the system **legible**.

They allow users to:
- understand how territory is being used
- observe patterns of participation
- see diversity of behavior without judgment

Roles are tools for understanding, not incentives.

---

## Canonical Role Categories

This chapter defines the first canonical roles.

### 🕰️ Veteran Colonists
Defined by:
- early presence
- or long continuous holding duration

Veterans are not privileged.
They are **historical anchors**.

---

### 🌱 Virgin Territories
Defined by:
- holding Solum
- with no outgoing transfers since acquisition

These territories are untouched.
They represent **potential**, not inactivity.

---

### 🔁 Active Colonists
Defined by:
- frequent transfers
- interaction with other colonists
- movement of territory

Activity is not good or bad.
It is simply **motion**.

---

### 🌋 Fertility Contributors
Defined by:
- selling to the pool
- contributing to burn, reflection, and liquidity dynamics

In Zipvilization logic:
- selling is not extraction
- it is **fertility**

These actions reshape the world.

---

### 🏔️ Major Landholders
Defined by:
- relative territory size compared to others

This role does not imply control.
It indicates **scale**.

---

## Role Coexistence

A colonist can be:
- a veteran
- with virgin territory
- and a major landholder

Roles overlap.
They are snapshots, not labels.

---

## What This Chapter Does NOT Do

This chapter does NOT:
- ❌ reward roles
- ❌ rank colonists morally
- ❌ restrict behavior
- ❌ introduce progression systems
- ❌ define governance

It observes.
It names.
It stops there.

---

## Relationship to Solumtools

Solumtools provides:
- raw transfers
- balances
- timelines

Chapter 3 interprets:
- patterns
- durations
- footprints

Nothing is invented.
Everything is derived.

---

## Relationship to SolumWorld

SolumWorld uses roles to:
- contextualize territory
- prepare future interactions
- support narrative layers later

But at this stage:
roles remain **quiet metadata**.

---

## Design Principle

> **Behavior before intention.**

Zipvilization does not care *why* someone acts.
Only *that* they act.

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Chapter 3 is complete when:

- All colonists are observable
- Roles are derived deterministically
- Roles can overlap and change
- No incentives or punishments exist

At this point, Zipvilization becomes a **living presence**.

Not yet a society.

---

## Final Note

This chapter introduces people,
without turning them into players.

The system now has inhabitants —
and history can begin.
