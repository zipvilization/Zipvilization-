# 👁️ Chapter 1 — Observability  
**Ver lo que ya existe**

---

## What This Chapter Is

Chapter 1 — Observability makes Zipvilization **legible**.

After Genesis proves that the system exists and operates correctly,
Observability ensures that anyone can:

- see what is happening
- verify it independently
- follow changes over time

Nothing new is created.
Nothing is interpreted.

Reality is simply **exposed**.

---

## Why Observability Comes First

A civilization that cannot be observed cannot be trusted.

Before worlds, maps, or narratives exist, users must be able to answer:

- Who holds territory?
- How much exists?
- What has changed?
- When did it change?
- Can I verify this myself?

Observability answers these questions without opinion.

## What Exists in Observability

This chapter introduces **structured access** to on-chain facts:

### 🔍 Wallet Visibility
- Any wallet can be inspected
- Balance (territory size)
- Basic activity history
- No classification, no labels

### 🔄 Transaction History
- Transfers, buys, sells
- Timestamped
- Linked to on-chain events
- No smoothing or aggregation that hides reality

### 📦 Supply State
- Total supply (live)
- Burned supply (cumulative)
- Genesis supply (constant reference)

### ⏱️ Time Awareness
- First activity
- Last activity
- Evolution over blocks and time

Everything is derived strictly from on-chain data.

## What Does NOT Exist Yet

Observability is intentionally restrained.

It does NOT include:

- ❌ Roles (colonist, veteran, etc.)
- ❌ World metaphors
- ❌ Maps or visual territory
- ❌ Progress bars or milestones
- ❌ Interpretation of behavior
- ❌ UI polish beyond clarity

If something requires interpretation, it belongs to a later chapter.

## Relationship to Solumtools

Observability is powered by **Solumtools**, but does not expose its full depth.

At this stage:
- Solumtools acts as a **lens**
- Not as an analyst
- Not as a storyteller

Only the minimum signals required for visibility are surfaced.

---

## Design Principle

> **Transparency before meaning.**

Users must be able to disagree with future interpretations.
That is only possible if the raw facts are visible first.

Observability ensures:
- trust without persuasion
- understanding without narrative
- verification without authority

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Chapter 1 is considered complete when:

- Any wallet can be inspected publicly
- Supply and burn are visible and consistent
- Transaction history is accessible and verifiable
- No off-chain explanation is required to understand the data

The system becomes *observable*, but not yet *interpreted*.

---

## Relationship to Future Chapters

Observability enables everything that follows:

- Roles require history
- Worlds require territory
- Evolution requires time
- Meaning requires context

Without Observability, all higher layers would be opaque.

---

## Final Note

Observability does not tell users what to think.

It tells them **what is there**.

Everything else comes later.
