# 🧭 Chapter 2 — Territory & World Coherence  
**Cuando los números ocupan espacio**

---

## What This Chapter Is

Chapter 2 introduces **space**.

After Chapter 1 makes Zipvilization observable,
this chapter gives structure to what is being observed.

From this point forward:
- balances are no longer just numbers
- supply is no longer just a metric
- wallets are no longer just addresses

They become **territory in a coherent world**.

---

## The Core Transformation

This chapter establishes a single, irreversible rule:

> **1 Solum = 1 m² of territory**

This mapping is:
- literal
- deterministic
- irreversible

There is no abstraction layer.
No scaling.
No narrative adjustment.

The blockchain already defines the world’s geometry.

---

## What “World” Means Here

At this stage, “world” does NOT mean:
- terrain types
- cities
- buildings
- visuals

It means **spatial coherence**.

The system now understands:
- how large the world is
- how much of it exists
- how it is distributed
- how it changes over time

---

## Territory Fundamentals

From this chapter onward, every wallet has:

### 🧱 Territory Size
- equal to its Solum balance
- measured in square meters (m²)

### 📍 Territory Position
- not geographic
- but **relational**
- defined by global supply and distribution

There is no map yet.
Only space that *can* be mapped later.

---

## Supply as Geography

The Solum supply defines the world’s physical limits:

- **Genesis Supply** → total possible world size
- **Live Supply** → active, inhabitable territory
- **Burned Supply** → permanent geography

Burned Solum does not disappear.

It becomes:
- rivers
- mountains
- forests
- non-claimable land

This is not cosmetic.
It is structural.

---

## What Exists in Chapter 2

This chapter introduces:

- 🌍 A finite world size
- 📐 A universal territory unit
- 🧮 Deterministic territory calculations
- 🧱 A clear distinction between:
  - inhabitable land
  - permanent geography

All of this is derived directly from on-chain data.

---

## What Does NOT Exist Yet

Territory does not imply behavior.

This chapter does NOT include:
- ❌ colonist roles
- ❌ progression systems
- ❌ ownership history interpretation
- ❌ visuals or UI metaphors
- ❌ incentives or goals

Territory simply **exists**.

---

## Relationship to SolumWorld

This chapter is the **foundation** of SolumWorld.

SolumWorld cannot exist without:
- spatial coherence
- consistent territory units
- irreversible geography rules

Chapter 2 defines the physics.
Later chapters define life within it.

---

## Relationship to Solumtools

Solumtools provides:
- balances
- supply
- burn data

Chapter 2 **reinterprets** these signals spatially,
without altering them.

Solumtools remains neutral.
Territory adds meaning.

---

## Design Principle

> **Space before society.**

You cannot build civilization
without first defining where it exists.

Chapter 2 does exactly that — and nothing more.

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Chapter 2 is complete when:

- The 1 Solum = 1 m² rule is enforced everywhere
- Total world size is explicit and immutable
- Burned supply is treated as permanent geography
- All territory calculations are deterministic

At this point, Zipvilization becomes a **place**.

Not yet a civilization.

---

## Final Note

This chapter does not ask users to act.

It gives them something to **stand on**.

The world now exists.
