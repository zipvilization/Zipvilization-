# ⏳ Chapter 4 — Time, History & Evolution  
**Cuando el mundo empieza a recordar**

---

## What This Chapter Is

Chapter 4 introduces **time**.

Up to now:
- territory existed
- colonists acted
- roles described behavior

But everything could still be read as a snapshot.

This chapter transforms Zipvilization into a **temporal system**.

What matters is no longer only *what exists*,  
but **how it got there**.

---

## Time as a First-Class Dimension

In Zipvilization, time is not cosmetic.

Time:
- is measurable
- is irreversible
- leaves traces
- accumulates meaning

Every state has a **past**.

---

## History Is Not Narrative

History here is **not storytelling**.

It is:
- ordered on-chain events
- state transitions
- irreversible changes

History is factual before it is interpretative.

---

## Canonical Temporal Axes

Chapter 4 defines three temporal axes:

### 🧱 World History
Tracks:
- total supply over time
- burned territory accumulation
- liquidity depth evolution
- treasury inflows (verified only)

This is the **geological time** of Zipvilization.

---

### 👤 Colonist History
For each colonist:
- first appearance
- territory changes
- role transitions
- periods of activity and inactivity

Colonists acquire **memory**.

---

### 🌍 Territory History
Territory is not static land.

It has:
- acquisition time
- duration of holding
- fragmentation or aggregation
- transformation through burn or transfer

Land remembers.

---

## Evolution ≠ Progress

This chapter explicitly avoids the concept of “progress”.

There is no:
- win condition
- end state
- optimal path

There is only **change over time**.

Evolution is descriptive, not aspirational.

---

## State Transitions

Every meaningful change is a **state transition**.

Examples:
- virgin territory → active territory
- colonist enters → colonist leaves
- supply decreases via burn
- roles appear or disappear

Transitions are:
- deterministic
- reproducible
- auditable

---

## Irreversibility

A key rule:

> **Time cannot be undone.**

Once:
- territory is burned
- history is written
- roles have existed

They cannot be erased.

Only layered over.

---

## Snapshots vs Timelines

Zipvilization supports two readings:

- **Snapshot view**: the world “now”
- **Timeline view**: how the world arrived here

Chapter 4 makes timelines canonical.

---

## Relationship to Solumtools

Solumtools provides:
- indexed events
- timestamps
- block ordering

Chapter 4 defines:
- how those events become history
- how states evolve between snapshots

---

## Relationship to SolumView

SolumView will later:
- visualize change
- animate evolution
- allow time navigation

But Chapter 4 is **purely structural**.

No UI assumptions.
Only temporal truth.

---

## What This Chapter Does NOT Do

This chapter does NOT:
- ❌ predict the future
- ❌ score evolution
- ❌ guide behavior
- ❌ define milestones

It records.

---

## Design Principle

> **A civilization without memory is not a civilization.**

Chapter 4 ensures Zipvilization remembers —
without deciding what should matter.

---

## Definition of Done (DoD)

Chapter 4 is complete when:

- All relevant events are ordered in time
- State transitions are explicit
- History cannot be rewritten
- Snapshots and timelines coexist

At this point, Zipvilization becomes **historical**.

---

## Closing Note

With time introduced,
Zipvilization stops being a static construct.

It becomes a **living record**.

The next step is inevitable:

What happens **when history accumulates enough weight**?
