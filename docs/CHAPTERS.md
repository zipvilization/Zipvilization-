# Zipvilization — Chapters

This document describes the current chapter structure of Zipvilization.

The chapters represent a **conceptual and structural vision** of how the
system may evolve over time. They are not a delivery roadmap, timeline,
or set of commitments.

Zipvilization is currently in **Chapter 0**.

The chapter structure may change as the experiment progresses.

---

## Chapter 0 — Genesis (current)

Chapter 0 defines the foundations of Zipvilization.

At this stage:
- The Solum contract is designed and prepared
- The core rules and constraints of the system are defined
- The conceptual framework of Zipvilization is established
- The repository acts as the primary truth and reference layer

No on-chain civilization exists yet.
This chapter focuses on coherence, clarity, and constraint definition
before the system becomes accessible.

---

## Chapter 1 — Colonization

Chapter 1 begins when the Solum contract becomes accessible on-chain
and initial liquidity is created.

At this stage:
- Solum transitions from a standalone token to interpreted territory
- Participants (“colonists”) acquire and hold Solum
- Transfers, trades, and burns generate observable system behavior
- Territory is no longer abstract, but still largely invisible

The system is active, but not yet visually legible.

## Chapter 2 — Solumtools

Chapter 2 introduces Solumtools, the interpretation layer of Zipvilization.

At this stage:
- On-chain data is read and translated into system-level signals
- Territory availability, fertility, flow, and distribution become visible
- Participants can observe the state of Zipvilization without interacting
  with it directly

Solumtools does not modify the system.
It only interprets and exposes verifiable data.

---

## Chapter 3 — SolumWorld

Chapter 3 explores the representation of Zipvilization as a world-like system.

At this stage:
- Interpreted data may be visualized as territory, settlements, or regions
- The system becomes perceptible beyond numerical metrics
- No gameplay objectives or control mechanisms are introduced

SolumWorld represents perception, not authority.

---

## Chapter 4 — SolumView

Chapter 4 focuses on experience and perspective.

At this stage:
- Participants may explore different views or scales of Zipvilization
- The emphasis is on understanding and immersion, not optimization
- The system remains governed by the same immutable rules

SolumView does not change Zipvilization.
It changes how it is perceived.

---

## Chapter 5 — Open Exploration

Chapter 5 represents the open horizon of Zipvilization.

At this stage:
- New forms of interaction may be explored
- Available resources may be reinvested into system evolution
- The experience of Zipvilization may be expanded for participants

Chapter 5 has no predefined scope.
Any exploration must remain consistent with the system’s constraints
and principles.

## Notes

- The chapter structure describes intent, not obligation
- Earlier chapters may be revisited or extended
- Later chapters may never be fully reached
- The experiment remains valid regardless of how many chapters are explored
