# 🧭 SolumView

**SolumView** is the **final visualization and interaction layer** of **Zipvilization**.

It is where all upstream systems — **Solum (token)** and **SolumWorld (state & rules)** —
become **visible, navigable, and inspectable** by humans and AI.

SolumView does not decide reality.  
It **renders** it.

---

## 🧩 What SolumView IS

✅ A deterministic **view layer**  
✅ A multi-zoom visual system  
✅ A wallet-aware explorer  
✅ A state-faithful renderer  
✅ The last step before human perception  

SolumView turns **on-chain state** and **off-chain rules**
into a **coherent visual surface**.

---

## 🚫 What SolumView is NOT

❌ It does not modify SolumWorld state  
❌ It does not execute economic logic  
❌ It does not simulate outcomes  
❌ It does not invent data  
❌ It does not override canon  

If something is not defined upstream, SolumView **cannot display it**.

## 🗂 Canonical Role inside Zipvilization

Solum → economic substrate (token) 
SolumWorld → rules, state, evolution 
SolumView → visualization, navigation, inspection

SolumView is the **only layer exposed directly to users**.

Everything shown here must be:
- traceable
- reproducible
- explainable

---

## 🔍 Zoom-Based Visualization

SolumView renders the world through **progressive zoom levels**.

Each zoom:
- reveals more detail
- never contradicts higher or lower zooms
- is derived from the same canonical data

Typical behavior:
- 🌍 High zoom → global patterns
- 🗺 Medium zoom → regions / clusters
- 🧱 Low zoom → parcels / units / structures

Zooms are **views**, not states.

---

## 👛 Wallet Mode

SolumView supports **Wallet Mode**.

A user can:
- 🔗 connect their own wallet
- 🔎 search any external wallet
- 👁 visualize holdings and positions
- 🧭 navigate the world **from that wallet’s perspective**

Wallet Mode:
- does not grant privileges
- does not alter state
- only filters and contextualizes views

---

## 🎨 Visual Determinism

SolumView follows strict **visual determinism**.

Given the same inputs:
- the same state
- the same wallet
- the same zoom

➡️ the output **must be identical**.

No randomness.  
No aesthetic drift.  
No temporal inconsistency.

Visuals are a **contract**, not decoration.

---

## 🧠 AI Compatibility

SolumView is designed to be:
- machine-readable
- AI-navigable
- structurally explicit

An AI agent must be able to:
- understand what it is seeing
- know why it is seeing it
- trace visuals back to source data

This enables:
- AI analysis
- AI explanation
- AI supervision

---

## 📐 Internal Documents

This folder contains canonical specifications such as:

- 📜 pipeline definitions
- 🔎 zoom rules
- 🎨 visual constraints
- 👛 wallet behavior
- 🧠 AI onboarding notes

Each file refines **how SolumView behaves**, not what exists.

---

## 🧩 Design Principle

> **SolumView shows reality.  
> It never creates it.**

If a visual cannot be justified by SolumWorld or Solum,
it must not exist.

---

## 🔒 Canon Status

This README is **canonical documentation**.

Changes must be:
- intentional
- minimal
- consistency-preserving

SolumView stability is critical:  
any drift here directly affects user trust.
