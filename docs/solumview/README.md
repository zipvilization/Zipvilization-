# 👁️ SolumView
### Territorial Visualization Layer

SolumView is the visual and dynamic representation of **Solum territory**.

It is not a game.  
It is not a strategy map.  
It is not a financial interface.

SolumView exists to **observe how the soil lives**.

## 🧠 What SolumView Is

SolumView is the close-range visualization layer of Zipvilization.

Its role is to:
- translate Solum state into visible territory
- express activity through space and time
- allow observation of the land as a lived surface

SolumView does not interpret rules.  
It does not alter execution.  
It **renders territory**.

---

## 📏 Human Scale

SolumView operates at **real scale**.

- **1 Solum = 1 square meter**
- scale must feel human, not symbolic
- territory occupies space

Nothing is abstracted into icons or charts.  
The land is meant to feel **physically present**.

---

## 👛 Wallet View (Core Mode)

SolumView is generated from the **wallet**.

- the visible area is derived from wallet balance
- the size of the terrain is automatic
- there is **no free zoom**
- there is **no manual camera control**

The system decides:
- which portion of the land is shown
- how much territory fits on screen
- how to preserve human scale and legibility

The user does not control the view.  
They **observe what their presence allows them to see**.

---

## 🔍 Maximum Zoom (Design Principle)

SolumView operates at **maximum zoom**.

- the terrain fills 100% of the frame
- the full property border is never visible
- land continues beyond the screen
- only a living fragment is shown

This avoids the perception of total control
and reinforces the idea of real spatial extension.

---

## ⏳ Time as a Visual Variable

SolumView is not static.

- changes are progressive
- evolution is slow
- territory reflects age and use

Young territories look different from older ones.

Nothing appears complete by default.  
Time must pass.

## 👥 Zips

Zips exist in SolumView.

They are:
- small
- non-protagonist
- functional indicators of activity

Zips:
- walk
- work
- interact with the environment
- appear and disappear according to land use

They do not represent characters.  
They represent **life on the soil**.

---

## 🏗️ Constructions and Land Use

Structures in SolumView are historical.

- no sudden jumps
- no instant final buildings
- complexity increases gradually

Examples:
- simple fields → organized fields
- informal paths → defined paths
- basic structures → consolidated ones

Architecture is not decorative.  
It records **what has happened over time**.

---

## 🎨 Visual Language

SolumView uses a strict visual language:

- pixel art
- 90s strategy inspiration
- 16-bit allowed
- flat colors
- hard edges

Not allowed:
- blur
- gradients
- modern lighting
- 3D
- cinematic or painterly styles

The style must remain **functional and readable**.

---

## 🌱 What SolumView Shows

SolumView shows:
- soil
- parcels
- paths
- fields
- small functional structures
- continuous low-level activity

It does not show:
- complete cities
- abstract icons
- heavy UI overlays

Everything visible belongs to the territory.

## 🧭 Relationship to Other Layers

- **Solum** → immutable execution
- **Solumtools** → structured signals
- **SolumWorld** → world-scale interpretation
- **SolumView** → lived territorial perception

SolumView is where the territory is **experienced**.
