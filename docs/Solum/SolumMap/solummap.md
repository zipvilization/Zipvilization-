# SolumMap

SolumMap is the territorial state visualization layer of Solum.

It does not represent land ownership.
It does not provide control or interaction.
It represents the accumulated consequences of Solum persistence over time.

SolumMap is observational by design.

## 1. Position Inside Semina

Semina is the system.
Solum is the economic substrate.
SolumMap is the visualization of Solum state evolution over time.

SolumMap does not optimize outcomes.
It reflects irreversible consequences.

---

## 2. Core Principles

- Everything is public. Nothing is judged.
- Time is a physical property, not a variable.
- Growth is slow. Collapse is proportional.
- The past is irreversible.
- No user actions are represented.
- No gamification is introduced.
- Observation replaces interaction.

SolumMap does not explain behavior.
It exposes it.

---

## 3. Temporal-Spatial Origin

The SolumMap has a single temporal origin.

This origin represents the earliest persistent state of the system,
not a privileged participant or founding entity.

The spatial center of the map corresponds to the oldest accumulated
history of Solum persistence.

Centrality reflects age, not power.
Persistence does not imply dominance.

As the system evolves, newer states emerge radially from this origin.
The origin itself is historical, not permanent.

---

## 4. Nucleus Logic

Each wallet has one and only one nucleus.

- The nucleus always exists.
- It is the oldest and most stable layer.
- Evolution propagates outward from the nucleus.
- New territory always begins at level zero.

Reflections feed the nucleus continuously.

When Solum is sold, the most recent layers are removed first.
Collapse proceeds from the periphery inward.

The core is resilient.
The periphery is fragile.

This asymmetry is intentional.

## 5. Zoom as Temporal Orientation

Zoom in SolumMap is not proximity.
It is a change in temporal interpretation density.

Zoom does not move closer to territory.
It moves closer to accumulated history.

Zoom is always centripetal, oriented toward the temporal origin of the system.

### Zoom Levels

**Zoom 0**
- Global aggregated system state
- No historical detail
- Statistical distribution only

**Zoom 1**
- Regional distribution
- Relative age patterns emerge
- No ownership visibility

**Zoom 2**
- Density and persistence patterns
- Emerging corridors and clusters

**Zoom 3**
- Long-lived regions
- Stable versus volatile zones
- Historical accumulation becomes legible

There is no maximum global zoom level.
The deepest readable state is determined exclusively by Wallet Mode.

---

## 6. Wallet Mode

Wallet Mode is the default viewing perspective.

It operates independently from Zoom levels.

- No manual zoom selection
- No camera control
- No toggles or sliders

The system determines the visible depth automatically.

- Smaller holders observe deeper local layers.
- Larger holders observe broader territorial states.
- The view always fills the screen.
- No voids or framing are allowed.

Wallet Mode enforces observational limits without introducing agency.

---

## 7. Evolution View (Temporal Compression)

Evolution View is a temporal observation layer.

It provides an accelerated visualization of system evolution
from genesis to the current state.

- No manual control
- No pause, rewind, or scrubbing
- Fixed duration
- Same visualization for all observers

Evolution View does not alter the system.
It does not reveal future states.
It does not enable optimization.

It exists solely to expose dynamic patterns of persistence and collapse.

---

## 8. Visual Constraints

SolumMap is a system visualization, not an aesthetic product.

- Conceptual baseline: 1 Solum = 1 m²
- Visual compression always applies
- The core never fragments visually
- Historical layers remain readable

Hard constraints:
- No cinematic lighting
- No gradients
- No blur
- No modern rendering
- No spectacle

Visual language references early system simulations,
not games or dashboards.

---

## 9. Final Note

SolumMap is not a game.
It is not a dashboard.

It is a living balance sheet of time, persistence, and loss.

Semina does not chase outcomes.
It observes what remains.
