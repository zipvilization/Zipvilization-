# SolumMap

SolumMap is the **state visualization layer** of Solum.

It represents how Solum persists, accumulates, and erodes over time,
translated into a territorial and civilizational abstraction.

SolumMap does not represent owned land.
It does not provide interaction or control.
It exists solely for observation.

---

## What SolumMap Is

- A deterministic visualization derived from Solum state
- A way to observe persistence, density, and collapse over time
- A territorial abstraction anchored to system history
- A read-only layer with no user agency

SolumMap reflects consequences.
It does not generate them.

---

## What SolumMap Is Not

- Not a game
- Not a strategy layer
- Not a simulation with player actions
- Not a dashboard for optimization
- Not a roadmap or feature preview

Any interpretation that treats SolumMap as an interactive system
is incorrect.

---

## Conceptual Structure

SolumMap is built on three core ideas:

1. **Temporal Origin**  
   Spatial centrality corresponds to historical persistence,
   not privilege or control.

2. **Zoom as Interpretation**  
   Zoom levels change temporal reading density,
   not camera proximity.

3. **Wallet Mode**  
   The visible depth and breadth are determined by the system,
   not by user choice.

## Evolution View

SolumMap includes an optional **Evolution View**:
a fixed-duration, non-interactive temporal compression
showing system evolution from genesis to the present.

It exists to reveal dynamics, not to enable prediction.

## How to Read This Directory

- `solummap.md`  
  Defines the conceptual and philosophical framework of SolumMap.

- `solummap_principles.md`  
  Defines the systemic interpretation principles used to translate on-chain reality
  into territorial transformation (neutrality, dormancy vs activity, burn as fertility,
  aggregation, temporal coherence).

- `solummap_technical_execution.md`  
  Describes how SolumMap can be implemented in a deterministic, stack-agnostic way,
  including minimal code sketches.

Readers are encouraged to start here, then proceed
in the order above.

## Scope and Limits

---

SolumMap intentionally avoids:
- promises of future functionality
- implementation commitments
- user-facing incentives

It is designed to remain coherent even if parts of the system
never evolve further.

## Relationship to SolumWorld

SolumMap focuses on **state visualization**.

SolumWorld builds on that state to explore
civilizational and societal interpretations.

SolumMap comes first.
SolumWorld derives from it.
