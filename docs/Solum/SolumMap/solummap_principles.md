This document defines the foundational systemic principles of SolumMap.

SolumMap is not a game layer, a narrative device, or a moral interface.
It is a visual, territorial projection of on-chain reality,
designed to translate economic activity into spatial transformation.

These principles govern how blockchain data is interpreted,
aggregated, visualized, and experienced.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 1 — SYSTEMIC BEHAVIORAL NEUTRALITY
----------------------------------------

No on-chain behavior is inherently good or bad.
Each action transforms the system in a different way.

The system learns from the totality of actions,
not from intentions, narratives, or ideals.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 2 — DORMANT VS ACTIVE SOLUM
----------------------------------------

Solum held in the liquidity pool is dormant.
Dormant Solum represents infertile, uncolonized territory.

Solum becomes active only when it exits the pool.
When Solum returns to the pool, it becomes dormant again.

The pool always represents available, infertile land.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 3 — BURN AS PERMANENT FERTILITY
----------------------------------------

Burned Solum permanently increases systemic fertility.

In SolumMap, burned Solum is expressed as forests,
water sources, and long-term life-supporting terrain.

Burn is irreversible and cumulative.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 4 — HOLDERS AS COLONIZERS
----------------------------------------

Wallets represent territorial colonies.

Their size, structure, and evolution depend on:
- Solum balance
- Historical activity
- Persistence over time

Colonies may appear as plots, villages, cities, or regions.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 5 — TRANSFERS AS TERRITORIAL MOTION
----------------------------------------

Transfers redistribute activity across the map.

They reshape territorial boundaries,
shift growth centers,
and generate meaningful spatial data.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 6 — TREASURY NON-MANIFESTATION
----------------------------------------

The treasury does not manifest physically on SolumMap.

Treasury data is transparent and accessible,
but it is represented only in SolumWorld,
not as territorial land.

This preserves conceptual clarity:
stored value is not colonized land.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 7 — DATA AGGREGATION OVER REAL-TIME NOISE
----------------------------------------

SolumMap does not render raw real-time blockchain activity.

Data is aggregated over defined intervals
to preserve coherence, readability, and trust.

The map must evolve, not flicker.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 8 — TEMPORAL COHERENCE
----------------------------------------

Visual transformations must feel causally consistent.

A user observing the map should perceive
growth, decay, or change as understandable processes,
not abrupt contradictions.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 9 — SCALE-DEPENDENT TRUTH
----------------------------------------

Different zoom levels reveal different truths.

Global views show macro fertility and expansion.
Local views show settlement structure and activity.

All views are derived from the same on-chain data.

----------------------------------------
PRINCIPLE 10 — COMPLETE VISIBILITY, CONTROLLED EXPERIENCE
----------------------------------------

SolumMap shows everything that happens on-chain.

However, the user experience is curated
to ensure clarity, continuity, and credibility.

Accuracy is preserved.
Chaos is filtered.

----------------------------------------

SolumMap is a living projection of the system,
not a judgment engine,
not a speculative interface,
and not a narrative shortcut.

It exists to be observed.
