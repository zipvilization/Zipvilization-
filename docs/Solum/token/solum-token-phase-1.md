# Solum — Phase 1 (Practical Overview)

Solum exists for one reason: to turn early participation into aligned liquidity, not hype.

This first phase is deliberately simple:
- a fixed-supply token with predefined taxes
- a public DEX pool
- a predictable flow of value inside the system (burn, reflections, liquidity, treasury)
- and a launch design where early participants can access the system with minimal friction.

This is not a promise of profit.  
It’s a mechanism with clear rules.

---

## 1) What Solum is (in practice)

Solum is a token designed to live inside a DEX pool from day one.

You can:
- buy and sell it on the pool like any other token
- hold it and receive reflections
- benefit from permanent supply pressure through real burns
- and benefit from long-term pool stability via liquidity reinforcement

It’s a token engineered to *stay on-chain and functional*, not to “tell a story” off-chain.

---

## 2) How taxes work in the frozen contract

Solum Phase 1 uses **different tax profiles** depending on how the token moves.

The contract distinguishes between:
- buys (from the DEX pool)
- sells (to the DEX pool)
- transfers (wallet to wallet)

Each action reinforces the system in a different way.

---

### Buy (from the pool)

**Total tax: 1%**

- **Liquidity — 0.5%**  
- **Treasury — 0.5%**

Buys are intentionally lightweight.

Early access is meant to be cheap and accessible while the pool is forming.  
Participation is prioritised over friction at entry.

---

### Sell (to the pool)

**Total tax: 10%**

- **Burn — 4%**  
- **Reflections — 3%**  
- **Liquidity — 2%**  
- **Treasury — 1%**

Sells represent value extraction from the pool.

For that reason, they carry the strongest reinforcement:
- supply is reduced
- long-term holders are rewarded
- liquidity depth is strengthened
- and the system sustains itself operationally

---

### Transfer (wallet to wallet)

**Total tax: 5%**

- **Burn — 2%**  
- **Reflections — 3%**

A transfer is not treated as a neutral action.

It represents a **change of custody** — a reassignment of participation.

---

## 3) Why transfers are taxed

Solum is not designed as a token that needs to move constantly.

Its name is not accidental.

Solum represents ground.  
Ground is held, not circulated.

Untaxed transfers would allow:
- silent reshuffling of supply
- indirect accumulation
- and manipulation without ever touching the pool

Taxing transfers prevents this.

It ensures that when Solum changes hands:
- supply is mechanically reduced
- alignment is rewarded through reflections
- and movement remains intentional

Solum does not punish holding.  
It makes movement meaningful.

---

## 4) The pool idea: why early access can be close to “cost zero”

In the earliest phase, the system is intentionally lightweight.

The practical effect is:
- early participants enter when the pool is small and thin
- buy-side friction is minimal
- and mistakes are survivable

This does **not** mean “free money”.

It means:
- access is cheap by design
- participation comes before speculation
- and position matters more than timing

Early access is not about winning fast.  
It’s about having room to be early.

---

## 4.5) Participation over speculation (the Phase 1 mindset)

Phase 1 of Solum is designed around participation, not speculation.

Early holders are not treated as investors betting on price.  
They are closer to settlers entering a system at its ground level.

The goal of this phase is not to extract value from the market,  
but to *form the market itself*.

Because entry is accessible:
- early participants can afford to be imperfect
- pressure to be “right” immediately is reduced
- alignment matters more than activity

Speculation may arrive later.  
It is not the foundation.

Holding Solum in Phase 1 is choosing presence over motion.

A Solum holder is not a passive investor.  
A Solum holder is a participant.

A colonist, not a tourist.

## 5) Who Phase 1 is for

Phase 1 is for people who:
- prefer transparent rules to marketing
- understand early-stage AMM dynamics
- value alignment over short-term extraction
- want to participate before systems become expensive to enter
- accept uncertainty as part of being early

This is not for you if you:
- want guarantees
- need a roadmap full of dates
- expect frictionless trading
- or are looking for a typical memecoin narrative

---

## 6) The simplest decision framework

Before participating, ask yourself:

1) Do I understand early-stage liquidity and volatility?  
2) Am I comfortable with asymmetric outcomes and long timelines?  
3) Do I value participation over constant movement?  
4) Does cheap early access align with my risk tolerance?

If your answers are mostly “yes”, Solum Phase 1 is coherent for you.

If not, waiting is also participation.

---

## 7) What happens after Phase 1

Phase 1 is the foundation layer.

Over time:
- Solum becomes one part of a larger system
- Semina builds on top of that ground
- and human intervention gradually fades

None of that matters if Phase 1 is not honest and stable.

So Phase 1 stays practical:
pool, rules, mechanics, transparency.

## Disclaimer

Solum is experimental. Crypto is high-risk.  
Nothing here is financial advice or a guarantee of outcomes.

Participate only if you understand the mechanism — not because you expect a result.
