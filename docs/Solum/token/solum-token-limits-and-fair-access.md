# Solum — On Limits, Fair Access, and Early Participation

This document explains why limits exist in Solum
and why they are not a restriction of freedom,
but a protection of purpose.

Solum Phase 1 is designed for participation.
Not for extraction.

---

## 1) Why limits matter in early systems

Early-stage systems are fragile.

Without limits:
- automation dominates
- capital concentration accelerates
- early participants are displaced
- and participation turns into short-term extraction

Solum Phase 1 rejects that path.

Limits are not a feature.
They are a safeguard.

---

## 2) No bots: participation must be human-scaled

Solum is not designed for automated exploitation.

Bots:
- amplify speed over intent
- turn access into advantage
- and collapse fairness in early pools

That is why Phase 1 is designed to discourage and restrict bot-driven behavior as much as possible.

This phase prioritizes:
- deliberate actions
- human-scale participation
- and patience over reaction speed

Solum is not a latency game.

## 3) No whales: concentration breaks alignment

Large, early accumulation creates structural imbalance.

When a few actors dominate supply:
- governance becomes implicit, not explicit
- price becomes fragile
- and community becomes secondary

Solum Phase 1 intentionally limits this dynamic.

The goal is not to prevent success,
but to prevent early capture.

Participation should be distributed,
not monopolized.

---

## 4) Cheap access does not mean free accumulation

Phase 1 is designed to be accessible.

That accessibility has a purpose:
- to allow people to enter early
- to learn
- to participate
- to make mistakes without catastrophic cost

It does **not** exist to allow:
- silent accumulation
- extraction-based strategies
- or rapid exit at the expense of others

Cheap access is about lowering the barrier to participation,
not about enabling hoarding.

---

## 5) Limits as a form of respect

Limits communicate intent.

They say:
- this is not a playground for capital dominance
- this is not a race for speed
- this is not an invitation to farm others

They say:
- your presence matters more than your size
- your alignment matters more than your timing

In that sense, limits are not restrictive.
They are respectful.

---

## 6) What Phase 1 is protecting

Phase 1 limits exist to protect:
- early participants from being displaced
- the pool from artificial volatility
- the system from early distortion
- and the community from becoming exit liquidity

They protect time.
They protect learning.
They protect trustless cooperation.

---

## 7) Speculation may arrive — but it is not invited early

Speculation is not forbidden.
It is simply not prioritized.

If Solum gains attention:
- liquidity will grow
- speculation will naturally appear
- and the system will adapt

But Phase 1 is not built for that audience.

It is built for those willing to:
- enter early
- stay present
- and accept limits as part of fairness

---

## 8) The boundary is clear

Solum Phase 1 is not for:
- bots
- capital dominance
- short-term extraction strategies

It is for:
- early participants
- human-scale involvement
- and those who understand that systems need protection while they grow

Limits are the line between participation and exploitation.

Solum chooses the former.

## Disclaimer

Solum is experimental.  
Crypto carries real risk.

Limits reduce certain risks,
but they do not remove uncertainty.

Participate only if you understand both.
