## Solum Token Launch Event

The Solum token launch refers to a single, well-defined public event:
the creation of the liquidity pool and its opening to the market.

This is the point at which Solum becomes tradable on-chain,
price discovery begins,
and participation is open to anyone under identical rules.

There are no private rounds.
There is no preferential access.
Once the pool is created, it is public by definition.

## Current State of Solum

Solum does not yet exist on-chain.

The token exists within Semina as a fully specified system:
its design is defined,
its behavior is documented,
and its economic logic is complete.

The smart contract is fully implemented and frozen.
It has not been deployed,
but it exists as finalized, executable code
and will not be altered.

This implies that:
- the economic model is closed
- the rules are known in advance
- and future behavior is not subject to discretionary changes

What does not yet exist is on-chain execution.
That occurs only when the liquidity pool is created.

## No Scheduled Date

There is no predetermined date for the public launch.

This is not indecision.
It is not delay.
And it is not a matter of technical readiness.

The limiting factor is not code,
but context.

Documentation, content, and shared understanding
are treated as part of the system itself.
Opening the pool before this context is sufficiently mature
introduces noise without increasing system quality.

For that reason, the public launch may occur imminently,
or it may occur months from now.

Both outcomes are valid.

Once a concrete date exists,
it will be communicated explicitly.
Not before.

## Community as a Precondition

Prior to the public launch,
community formation is critical.

Semina requires a prelaunch community:
a group that is active,
engaged,
and substantively interested,
capable of giving life to the system
before market exposure.

This is not a question of scale,
but of signal.

This initial community:
- generates informed interest
- stress-tests ideas and assumptions
- amplifies interpretation and context
- and begins to assign meaning to the economic substrate
before open trading exists

Without community,
the substrate remains structural.
With community,
it becomes functional.

---

## Community, Amplification, and Growth

The community is not a passive audience.

Its role is not limited to observation,
but includes amplification,
inhabitation,
and contribution to system vitality.

Amplification does not imply distortion,
but deliberate extension.

To inhabit the system is not to claim ownership,
but to participate with awareness of constraints and intent.

Growth emerges from this process
not through artificial acceleration,
but through accumulated understanding.

---

## Colonization Before Market Exposure

Semina prioritizes colonization before market opening.

Colonization implies:
- gradual entry
- sustained involvement
- shared responsibility
- tolerance for uncertainty

Only once a ground is meaningfully inhabited
does market exposure become appropriate.

Solum provides the ground.
The community activates it.
The market exposes it.

---

## Continuous Evolution

As the community forms,
Semina continues to evolve structurally,
and Aitopia continues to learn and develop.

This process precedes the public launch
and continues afterward.

The launch does not mark the beginning of the system,
but the point at which it becomes externally observable.

When the pool is opened,
Solum will exist on-chain
and will be governed exclusively by its predefined rules.

No additional guarantees are offered.
No implicit outcomes are suggested.

The system is already in motion.
