# SolumWorld — Data Ethics & Interpretation Boundaries

## Why this document exists

SolumWorld exposes large volumes of on-chain data in a human-readable,
civilization-style format.

That power carries risk.

This document defines **ethical and interpretative boundaries** to ensure
SolumWorld informs without distorting, guiding without manipulating,
and reveals without judging.

---

## Principle 1 — Data is neutral, interpretation is human

SolumWorld does not assign moral value to behavior.

- Buying is not “good”
- Selling is not “bad”
- Holding is not “virtuous”
- Transferring is not “suspicious”

All on-chain actions are **mechanical interactions with rules**.

Any meaning emerges from patterns over time, not single events.

---

## Principle 2 — Visibility is not judgment

SolumWorld makes behavior visible.
It does not classify intent.

There are:
- no warnings
- no flags
- no blacklist indicators
- no trust scores

A wallet’s history is shown exactly as it occurred,
without editorial framing.

---

## Principle 3 — Contribution is multidimensional

Contribution to Solum is not limited to holding.

Examples of contribution include:
- providing liquidity indirectly via taxes
- participating in burn mechanics through sells
- maintaining long-term presence
- redistributing supply through transfers

SolumWorld reflects **flows**, not opinions about those flows.

---

## Principle 4 — Reputation is descriptive, not prescriptive

If SolumWorld displays any form of reputation or status, it must be:

- derived strictly from observable data
- non-actionable at protocol level
- non-transferable
- reversible over time

Reputation never grants:
- privileges
- protections
- exemptions
- advantages

It exists only as information.

---

## Principle 5 — No behavioral nudging

SolumWorld does not attempt to:
- incentivize specific actions
- discourage participation
- shape market behavior
- influence price dynamics

There are no alerts designed to provoke urgency,
fear, or herd behavior.

Observation is the goal.
Reaction is the user’s responsibility.

---

## Principle 6 — Misinterpretation is a known risk

Complex systems are often misread.

SolumWorld explicitly acknowledges:
- correlation is not causation
- short-term patterns are misleading
- early-stage systems are noisy

Where necessary, contextual explanations may appear,
but **never conclusions**.

---

## Principle 7 — No external moral overlay

SolumWorld does not import:
- traditional finance assumptions
- crypto tribal narratives
- speculative heuristics
- social scoring systems

Its worldview is defined only by:
- Solum’s rules
- observable outcomes
- time

---

## Final boundary

SolumWorld is not a referee.
It is not an oracle.
It is not a guide.

It is a mirror.

What users see depends on:
- how long they look
- what questions they ask
- and what assumptions they bring with them
