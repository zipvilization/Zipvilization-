# SolumWorld

SolumWorld is the **civilizational interpretation layer** built on top of Solum.

It explores how persistent on-chain state, when observed over time,
can be interpreted as structures resembling settlement, growth,
organization, and collapse.

SolumWorld does not simulate society.
It does not introduce agency.
It does not optimize outcomes.

It exists to interpret, not to control.

## What SolumWorld Is

- A conceptual layer derived from Solum state
- An interpretive framework for civilizational patterns
- A non-interactive reading of long-term persistence
- A bridge between on-chain data and systemic meaning

SolumWorld observes structure.
It does not generate it.

---

## What SolumWorld Is Not

- Not a game world
- Not a metaverse
- Not a simulation with actors or decisions
- Not a governance system
- Not a promise of future functionality

Any interpretation that treats SolumWorld as an interactive or playable
environment is incorrect.

---

## Conceptual Role

SolumWorld exists **after** SolumMap.

- Solum defines persistence and erosion
- SolumMap visualizes that state
- SolumWorld interprets the resulting patterns

It is a layer of meaning, not mechanics.

---

## Relationship to Aitopia

SolumWorld provides structured signals that can be observed,
interpreted, and reasoned about.

It does not decide.
It does not act.
It does not optimize.

Any future cognitive layer (human or non-human)
must treat SolumWorld as descriptive input, not authority.

## How to Read This Directory

- `solumworld.md`  
  Defines the core conceptual framework of SolumWorld.

- `solumworld_technical_execution.md`  
  Describes how SolumWorld can be derived from Solum state in a
  technically plausible, non-interactive way.

- `solumworld_information_loop.md`  
  Explores how SolumWorld can act as a signal layer without
  introducing control or feedback loops.

- `solumworld_onchain_civilization.md`  
  Examines the mapping between on-chain persistence and
  civilizational metaphors.

- `solumworld_data_ethics_and_interpretation.md`  
  Defines ethical boundaries, interpretive limits, and
  constraints on meaning extraction.

Readers are encouraged to start with `solumworld.md`
and proceed according to interest.

## Scope and Limits

SolumWorld intentionally avoids:
- predictions
- incentives
- agency
- optimization
- narrative authority

It is designed to remain coherent even if the system
never evolves beyond observation.

---

## Position in the System

SolumWorld is not the system.
It is not the horizon.

It is a **lens**.

A way to look at persistence
without mistaking observation for control.
