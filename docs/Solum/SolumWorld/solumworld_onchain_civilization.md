# SolumWorld: On-chain Civilization

## What is SolumWorld

SolumWorld is the observational and narrative layer of the Semina ecosystem.

It is not a game.
It is not a dashboard.
It is not a simulation detached from reality.

SolumWorld is a living representation of an on-chain system evolving in real time.

Where Solum defines the terrain,  
SolumWorld makes that terrain visible.

## Core Idea

SolumWorld treats the Solum smart contract as a world.

- The contract is the ground.
- Liquidity is fertility.
- Treasury flows are infrastructure.
- Burns are exhausted land that enriches what remains.
- Wallets are colonists.
- Transactions are actions.
- Time is progression.

Nothing is fictional.
Everything is derived from on-chain data.

## Civilization, not speculation

SolumWorld intentionally shifts perspective:

From:
- price tracking
- short-term performance
- individual optimization

To:
- system evolution
- collective behavior
- long-term sustainability

This is closer to a **civilization model** than a market model.

Inspired by:
- city builders (SimCity)
- civilization simulators (Civilization)
- but grounded entirely in real blockchain data

---

## Colonists (Wallets)

Every wallet interacting with Solum is a colonist.

SolumWorld does not judge behavior as good or bad.
It classifies contribution.

- Holding contributes stability.
- Selling contributes liquidity, treasury, and redistribution.
- Transferring moves resources across the terrain.

Even destructive actions have systemic effects.

Information replaces moral labeling.

---

## Reputation and Visibility

SolumWorld introduces visibility, not punishment.

Potential future signals (non-enforced, informational only):
- longevity
- participation patterns
- interaction frequency
- contribution to liquidity and treasury

These signals do not grant rights.
They tell stories.

## Why SolumWorld exists

SolumWorld exists to demonstrate two fundamental ideas of Semina:

1. Autonomous systems can be created by a human + AI process  
   and then live independently through code and community interaction.

2. Continuous on-chain data creates a feedback surface  
   for learning, analysis, and future system design.

SolumWorld is both:
- a mirror of Solum
- and a laboratory for Semina

---

## Transparency as terrain

SolumWorld is not a marketing layer.

It exposes:
- fragility
- imbalance
- growth
- stagnation
- recovery

Civilizations are not always efficient.
They are observable.

---

## Status

SolumWorld is in conceptual genesis.

- No public code yet
- No promises of timelines
- No feature commitments

The structure is defined first.
Implementation follows.

---

## Closing

Solum defines rules.
SolumWorld reveals consequences.

The system does not tell participants what to do.
It shows them where they stand.

This is not a product.
It is a world.
