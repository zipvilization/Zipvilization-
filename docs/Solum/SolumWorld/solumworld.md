# SolumWorld

SolumWorld is the observable world generated from the Solum economic system.

It is not the system itself, and it does not define rules or outcomes.  
SolumWorld exists to translate on-chain activity into a coherent, human-readable, and visually interpretable environment.

Its purpose is not speculation or gamification, but **understanding**.

---

## Position within Semina

Semina is the system.  
Solum is the economic substrate.  
SolumWorld is the world that emerges from their interaction.

SolumWorld does not control Semina, and it does not influence Solum’s rules.  
It observes, interprets, and exposes what already exists on-chain.

This separation is intentional and strict.

## What SolumWorld is

SolumWorld is:

- A public-facing platform for observing Solum activity
- A visualization layer built on verified blockchain data
- A narrative and analytical interface for long-term system behavior
- A bridge between raw on-chain mechanics and human perception

SolumWorld transforms data into a **living environment**, not into predictions or guidance.

---

## What SolumWorld is not

SolumWorld is not:

- A control panel
- A governance layer
- A trading interface
- A promise of outcomes or performance
- A replacement for reading the smart contract

Nothing shown in SolumWorld overrides or alters on-chain reality.

## Relationship to SolumMap

SolumMap is a subsystem of SolumWorld.

While SolumWorld represents the broader observable world,  
SolumMap is the **territorial representation** of Solum itself.

SolumMap focuses exclusively on land, activity, transformation, and colonization as derived from Solum’s movement and state changes.

SolumMap does not exist independently from SolumWorld.

---

## Time, rhythm, and perception

SolumWorld does not aim to mirror the blockchain tick by tick.

While the underlying data is on-chain and verifiable, SolumWorld prioritizes **perceptual coherence** over raw immediacy.

Updates may be batched, smoothed, or paced to ensure that:

- Large-scale patterns remain readable
- Local changes do not create visual noise
- The world feels alive, not chaotic

Every transformation shown is grounded in real data, but presented at a human scale.

---

## Transparency and limits

SolumWorld is transparent by design, but not exhaustive by default.

All information displayed is derived from publicly verifiable sources.  
However, not all data must be rendered visually at all times.

Some elements of the system may remain abstracted or contextualized elsewhere in the Semina ecosystem.

This is not opacity.  
It is intentional separation of concerns.

---

## Role within the experiment

SolumWorld exists to make Semina observable.

It allows participants, developers, and external reviewers to:

- Observe long-term behavior
- Detect emergent patterns
- Understand how constraints shape outcomes
- Evaluate the system without relying on narratives or promises

SolumWorld does not guide participation.  
It reveals consequences.

---

## Status

SolumWorld is under active conceptual and technical development.

Its structure is public.  
Its implementation is iterative.  
Its evolution follows the same principles as Semina itself: clarity first, expansion second.

No guarantees are implied.
