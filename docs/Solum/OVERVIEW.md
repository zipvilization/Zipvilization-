# Solum — Overview

Solum is the economic and territorial layer connected to Semina.
It can be read in two different ways, and this section exists to reduce confusion.

## What Solum is

- A tokenized participation surface tied to a territorial representation (SolumMap).
- A Phase 1 design that prioritizes accessibility and early participation before valuation.
- A set of explicit constraints meant to keep the early system readable and honest.

## What Solum is not

- Not a promise of returns.
- Not a roadmap-driven product with guaranteed milestones.
- Not a “fully solved” economy.
- Not a narrative that requires belief or persuasion.

## How to read this folder

- If you want the territorial representation and UI logic, start with SolumMap/.
- If you want the world-level framing, start with SolumWorld/.
- If you want Phase 1 conditions, read:
  - solum-token-phase-1.md
  - solum-token-limits-and-fair-access.md
  - solum-honesty-and-constraints.md
- If you want technical references, read solum-contract.md.

## Relationship to Semina

Semina is an immutable horizon and alignment constant.
Solum is an evolving layer that can change across phases.

This folder documents Solum as an evolving layer,
without redefining Semina’s immutable texts.
