# 🧭 Project

This folder defines the **foundational posture** of Zipvilization.

It does not describe how the system is implemented.  
It describes **why it exists**, **how it begins**, and **how it relates to its participants**.

Everything here is **canonical**, **public**, and **intentional**.

---

## 📂 What This Folder Contains

The `project` folder gathers documents that define:

- the origin of Zipvilization  
- the conditions of its birth  
- the logic behind its launch  
- the role of early participants  
- the project’s stance on communication and community  
- the explicit assumptions under which the system exists  
- the security posture of the experiment  

These documents are not speculative.  
They are statements of intent.

## 🧬 LORE_GENESIS.md — Origin

**What it answers:**
- What is a civilization in Zipvilization?
- Where does it exist?
- How does a world emerge from an abstract substrate?

This document establishes:
- the non-physical nature of the world
- the absence of characters at the beginning
- the idea that territory, history, and civilization emerge *after* activity

Lore here is not fantasy.  
It is interpretation of reality.

## 🚀 TOKEN_LAUNCH.md — Birth Conditions

**What it answers:**
- How does Solum enter existence?
- Where is it launched?
- Why is initial access almost free?

This document defines:
- the launch environment (Base network, Aerodrome pool)
- the absence of a fixed launch date
- the rationale behind full-supply pool seeding
- the mechanical accessibility of early participation

Token Launch is not an event.  
It is a transition from potential to existence.

---

## 🔓 EARLY_ACCESS.md — First Participation

**What it answers:**
- Why early access exists
- Who it is for
- What it does *and does not* promise

This document explains:
- why randomness at birth is dangerous
- the role of early colonists
- why understanding matters more than speed
- why the mechanism is intentionally not finalized yet

Early Access is a structural phase, not a reward.

---

## 📡 COMMUNICATION.md — Posture & Channels

**What it answers:**
- How Zipvilization communicates
- Why it avoids real-time community platforms
- What role GitHub, X, Medium, and the website play

This document clarifies:
- why absence of Discord/Telegram is intentional
- why GitHub is the canonical source of truth
- why other platforms are explanatory, not authoritative
- how enthusiasm is expressed without hype

Communication exists to explain, not to negotiate reality.

---

## 🔐 SECURITY.md — Security Posture

**What it answers:**
- What “security” means in Zipvilization
- What it explicitly does *not* mean
- Where responsibility begins and ends

This document establishes that security in Zipvilization is about:
- immutability of rules
- equality of execution
- auditability of logic
- resistance to discretionary intervention

Security here does not imply:
- protection of value
- prevention of loss
- guarantees of outcome

Zipvilization is secure in **execution**, not in **results**.

---

## 🧠 ASSUMPTIONS.md — System Premises

**What it answers:**
- Under which assumptions Zipvilization exists
- What is taken as given
- What is intentionally *not* corrected or optimized

This document makes explicit that:
- markets are chaotic
- behavior is unpredictable
- failure is possible
- participation is asymmetric
- interpretation does not imply endorsement

Assumptions are not hidden risks.  
They are part of the system itself.

## 🧱 How These Documents Work Together

These files define the **conditions of existence**:

- Lore defines *what kind of world* this is  
- Token Launch defines *how it enters reality*  
- Early Access defines *how participation begins*  
- Communication defines *how meaning is shared*  
- Assumptions define *what is taken as given*  
- Security defines *what is protected and what is not*  

They precede:
- Solum (contract)
- Solumtools (interpretation)
- SolumWorld (world coherence)
- SolumView (visual experience)

Without this folder, everything else lacks context.

---

## 🔒 Canonical Status

All documents in this folder are:
- public
- versioned
- auditable
- binding at the level of intent

If something is not stated here,  
it is not assumed.

---

## 📌 Final Note

This folder does not describe features.

It describes **responsibility**.

Before code runs,  
before tokens move,  
before the world becomes visible,

the project must know  
*what it is doing* and *why*.

This is that place.
