# 🧭 Project

This folder defines the **foundational posture** of Zipvilization.

It does not describe how the system is implemented.
It defines **why the project exists**, **how it enters reality**, and **under which constraints it operates**.

Everything here is **canonical**, **public**, and **intentional**.

If something is not stated in this folder,  
it must not be assumed elsewhere.

---

## 📂 What This Folder Is

The `project` folder contains the documents that define:

- the origin of Zipvilization
- the conditions of its birth
- the logic of its launch
- the role of early participants
- the limits under which the project operates
- the posture toward communication, trust, and responsibility

This folder exists **before code**.

It is the layer where intent is fixed
so that implementation cannot drift.

---

## 🧬 Origin — *What kind of world is this?*

### `LORE_GENESIS.md`

This document defines the **foundational narrative frame** of Zipvilization.

It answers:
- what “civilization” means in this context
- where this world exists
- how territory and history emerge from abstract activity

There are no characters at the beginning.
There is no fiction imposed.

Lore here is **interpretation of reality**, not fantasy.

---

## 🚀 Birth — *How does the system enter reality?*

### `TOKEN_LAUNCH.md`

This document defines the **conditions of existence** for Solum.

It explains:
- where the token is launched
- why there is no fixed launch date
- why initial access is mechanically cheap
- how the first moments are structured to reduce distortion

Token Launch is not a marketing event.
It is the transition from potential to execution.

---

## 🔓 First Participation — *Who enters first, and why?*

### `EARLY_ACCESS.md`

This document defines the **early participation phase**.

It explains:
- why uncontrolled randomness at birth is dangerous
- why early understanding matters more than speed
- why the mechanism is intentionally not finalized yet

Early Access is not a reward.
It is a structural stabilizer.

---

## 🔐 Limits & Responsibility — *What is explicitly assumed and protected?*

### `ASSUMPTIONS.md`

This document lists the **explicit assumptions** under which Zipvilization operates.

It defines:
- what the project assumes about users, markets, and environments
- what it does *not* attempt to solve or guarantee

Nothing outside these assumptions is implied.

---

### `SECURITY.md`

This document defines the **security posture** of the project.

It clarifies:
- what is protected by design
- what is intentionally left unprotected
- why no system-level guarantees are claimed

Security here is about **honesty of scope**, not absolute safety.

---

## 🏛️ Resources — *How does the project sustain itself?*

### `TREASURY.md`

This document defines the **role of the treasury**.

It explains:
- why the project starts with minimal economic investment
- why access for colonists is almost free
- why resources are still required to grow

It makes explicit that:
- the human factor has no special privilege
- no speculative advantage is claimed
- funds exist to sustain development, not extract value

---

## 🧾 After Launch — *What guarantees follow existence?*

### `POST_LAUNCH_GUARANTEES.md`

This document defines the **post-launch commitments**.

It covers:
- liquidity handling principles
- ownership and control posture
- transparency about future decisions

It does not promise outcomes.
It commits to **explicit decision-making**.

---

## 📡 Communication — *How meaning is shared*

### `COMMUNICATION.md`

This document defines the **communication posture** of Zipvilization.

It explains:
- why there is no Discord or Telegram
- why GitHub is the canonical source of truth
- why other platforms exist for explanation, not authority

Communication exists to **clarify**, not to negotiate reality.

---

## 🧱 How These Documents Work Together

These files define the **conditions of existence**:

- Lore defines the nature of the world
- Token Launch defines how it begins
- Early Access defines how participation starts
- Assumptions and Security define limits
- Treasury defines sustainability
- Post-launch guarantees define honesty over time
- Communication defines how meaning is transmitted

They precede:
- Solum (contract)
- Solumtools (interpretation)
- SolumWorld (coherence)
- SolumView (visibility)

Without this folder, everything else lacks context.

---

## 🔒 Canonical Status

All documents in this folder are:
- public
- versioned
- auditable
- binding at the level of intent

If something is not stated here,
it is not part of the project’s promise.

---

## 📌 Final Note

This folder does not describe features.

It defines **responsibility**.

Before code executes,
before tokens move,
before the world becomes visible,

the project must know  
**what it is doing** and **why**.

This is that place.
