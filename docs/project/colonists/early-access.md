# Early Access (Phase 0)

Early access in Zipvilization exists for one reason only:

**to protect the initial phase of the system from distortion.**

This document defines how and why early access is granted, and what it does — and does not — imply.

---

## 1. Purpose of Early Access

Phase 0 of Zipvilization is structurally fragile.

Low participation, low activity, and incomplete tooling create conditions where:
- A small number of actors can dominate the system
- Rules cannot express their intended behavior
- The experiment becomes invalid before it begins

Early access exists to **ensure sufficient, distributed participation at launch**.

It is a defensive mechanism, not a reward.

---

## 2. Whitelist as a Structural Tool

Early access is implemented through a **whitelist**.

The whitelist does not represent trust, belief, or endorsement.
It represents **prior coordination**.

Its sole purpose is to:
- Guarantee access to Phase 0
- Prevent exclusion by opportunistic behavior
- Ensure a minimum number of active colonists at launch

---

## 3. Who Can Be Whitelisted

Early access may be granted to participants who:

- Help communicate the existence of Zipvilization
- Contribute feedback during Phase 0
- Assist in testing visibility, tooling, or interpretation layers
- Participate constructively in early observation

No technical contribution is required.
No capital commitment is required.

Participation is social and structural, not financial.

---

## 4. What Early Access Does NOT Grant

Being whitelisted does not grant:

- Preferential economic treatment
- Permanent advantages
- Governance rights
- Influence over rules
- Protection from loss

Once Phase 0 ends, the whitelist **loses relevance**.

Rules apply equally to all participants.

---

## 5. Temporary and Revocable

Early access is:

- Temporary
- Limited to Phase 0
- Revocable if abused

The whitelist is not a membership list.
It is a launch instrument.

---

## 6. Transition Out of Early Access

When Zipvilization reaches sufficient participation density:

- Early access is removed
- Access becomes open
- The system operates without coordination layers

The goal of early access is its own disappearance.

---

## Closing Note

Early access is not about being early.

It is about being **present when presence matters**.

Zipvilization does not reward belief or speculation.
It requires participation to exist at all.
