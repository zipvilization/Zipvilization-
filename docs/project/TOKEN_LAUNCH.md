# 🚀 TOKEN_LAUNCH — Canonical Birth Conditions

This document defines **how Solum enters existence**.

It does not describe marketing.
It does not announce dates.
It does not promise outcomes.

It defines the **mechanical, auditable conditions** under which
the Zipvilization experiment begins.

---

## 🌐 Where the Launch Happens

Solum is launched **exclusively** on:

- **Network:** Base
- **DEX:** Aerodrome (V2-style pool)

There is no multi-chain launch.
There is no alternative pool.
There is no secondary genesis.

If Solum does not exist in this environment,
it does not exist at all.

---

## ⏳ No Fixed Launch Date

There is **no predetermined launch date**.

The pool will be created only when:

- the contract is final
- the documentation is complete
- the mechanics are publicly auditable
- early participants have had time to understand and critique the system

Speed is not a goal.
Correctness is.

---

## 💧 Full-Supply Pool Seeding

At launch, **100% of the Solum supply** is seeded into the pool.

The initial liquidity is intentionally minimal
(approximately 100€ worth of ETH, adjusted at launch time).

This design choice is deliberate.

### Why this matters

- There is no artificial scarcity at genesis
- There is no privileged pre-allocation
- Price discovery is emergent, not engineered
- Access is mechanical, not discretionary

The result is an entry condition where
**participation is structurally inexpensive**, not selectively granted.

Early access is not free — it is *mechanically accessible*.

---

## 🧱 The Protected Launch Phase (First 48 Hours)

The first 48 hours after trading is enabled
are treated as the **most fragile phase** of the system.

During this period, **additional protections apply**.

These protections are **on-chain rules**, not policies.

---

## 🛒 Buy-Side Restrictions (48h Only)

During the protected phase:

- **Only BUY transactions are restricted**
- **SELL transactions are always allowed**
- **Transfers remain unrestricted**

### Buy constraints:
- Maximum per buy: **MAX_TX**
- Cooldown per wallet: **60 minutes**
- Cooldown applies only to BUY actions

This ensures:
- no rapid accumulation
- no high-frequency dominance
- equal temporal access per wallet

Participation is paced.
Not blocked.

---

## 🔓 Whitelist Priority Access (First 60 Minutes)

Within the protected phase, an additional rule applies:

- **Whitelisted wallets** have **priority access** during the **first 60 minutes**
- This priority does **not** change:
  - max transaction size
  - cooldown rules
  - wallet limits

Whitelist access means:
- the right to participate early
- **not** the right to accumulate more

This distinction is fundamental.

---

## 🧭 After the Protected Phase

Once the first 48 hours pass:

- buy cooldowns are removed
- launch-specific restrictions expire
- the contract behaves according to its permanent rules

Nothing is toggled manually.
Nothing is extended.
Nothing is negotiated.

Time alone resolves the phase.

---

## ⚖️ Design Rationale

These mechanics exist to protect:

- early coherence
- observational clarity
- resistance to launch chaos
- meaningful initial participation

They are not defensive measures.
They are **structural constraints**.

They do not favor insiders.
They do not punish activity.

They enforce **temporal fairness**.

---

## 🔒 Canonical Status

All rules described here:

- are implemented on-chain
- are enforced automatically
- are time-bound
- are publicly auditable

If a behavior is not allowed by the contract,
it does not exist during launch.

If a rule is not described here,
it should not be assumed.

---

## 📌 Final Note

Token Launch is not an event.

It is the moment when:
- abstract rules begin producing history
- territory becomes measurable
- participation becomes visible

Nothing more.
Nothing less.
