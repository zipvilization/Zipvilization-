# 🧬 Token Launch — How Access to Zipvilization Begins

## What Token Launch Means Here

In Zipvilization, *Token Launch* is not a promotional event.

It is the moment when access to the system becomes possible.

There is no countdown.  
There is no announcement rush.  
There is no attempt to impress.

The launch simply opens the door.

## 🌍 Where Solum Is Launched

Solum will be launched on:

- **Base network**
- **Aerodrome (V2-style liquidity pool)**

There will be **one public pool**, created directly on-chain.

No private allocations.  
No early price deals.  
No privileged liquidity.

If you access Solum, you do it the same way as everyone else.

---

## 🧱 How the Pool Is Created

At launch:

- **100% of the Solum supply** is placed in the liquidity pool  
- The counter asset is **ETH (Base)**  
- The ETH side of the pool is intentionally small  
  (around **100€ equivalent** at launch)

This is not an oversight.  
It is the result of design and simulation.

---

## 💡 Why Access Is Almost Free

Solum’s launch parameters have been **simulated extensively**.

The objective was not price discovery,  
but **wide, fair, early access**.

Because:
- the full supply is in the pool
- the initial ETH is very small
- and there is a **maximum transaction size**

the result is predictable:

**Thousands of early accesses can happen at negligible cost.**

In simulations:
- using the **maximum allowed transaction** (10,000,000,000 Solum)
- the first **several thousand participants**
- could access Solum for **well under 1€ / $1** (plus gas)

Even deep into the sequence (around the ~9,000th access),
the cost remained extremely low.

This is not a promise of value.  
It is a consequence of math.

---

## 🧭 What This Means in Practice

- Solum is not “sold” by the project  
- There is no fixed price  
- There is no privileged entry point  

Access is:
- public
- mechanical
- rule-based

The system does not care who you are.  
It only executes.

---

## 🧠 Why This Design Exists

Zipvilization needs **density**, not valuation.

It needs:
- many territories
- many colonists
- varied behavior
- real movement

An expensive launch would concentrate access.  
A cheap launch distributes it.

This is essential for the experiment.

---

## ⏳ No Fixed Launch Date

There is **no scheduled launch date**.

The token will be launched only when:
- contracts are final
- documentation is complete
- the system can be audited and criticized
- an initial community understands what this is — and what it is not

Speed adds nothing here.  
Clarity does.

---

## 👥 Community Before Activation

Before launch, Zipvilization focuses on:
- explaining itself
- being challenged
- being understood

This phase exists so that:
- early participants are not accidental
- first data is meaningful
- the system does not start distorted

This is directly related to **Early Access**.

---

## 🔓 Relationship to Early Access

Early Access does **not** mean:
- guaranteed allocation
- free tokens
- special prices

It means:
- early understanding
- early presence
- early contribution to clarity

The exact mechanics are still being evaluated  
(using existing whitelist and access tools).

When defined, they will be documented here.

---

## 🔍 Transparency & Auditability

Everything about Token Launch is:
- documented in GitHub
- visible before execution
- verifiable on-chain after execution

If something is not written here,  
it should be assumed **not to exist**.

---

## 🧩 In Short

Token Launch in Zipvilization is:

- minimal  
- accessible  
- deliberately unexciting  
- structurally fair  

It does not try to impress.

It simply makes the world reachable.
