# 🏛️ POST_LAUNCH_GUARANTEES

This document defines the **post-launch guarantees and commitments** of Zipvilization.

It does not describe speculative promises.
It describes **structural constraints**, **operational decisions**, and **explicit limits** placed on the project after Token Launch.

Everything stated here is:
- public
- auditable
- intentional

If a behavior is not described here, it is not assumed.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Document

Zipvilization is not protected by trust.
It is protected by **structure**, **rules**, and **public accountability**.

This document exists to clarify:

- how Zipvilization behaves after launch
- which actions are constrained
- which decisions remain flexible (and why)
- how honesty is enforced even under uncertainty

---

## 🧱 Core Principle

> Zipvilization does not optimize for appearances.  
> It optimizes for **coherence over time**.

Post-launch guarantees are not marketing tools.
They are safeguards against erosion of intent.

---

## 💰 Treasury — Role & Constraints

### What the Treasury Is

The treasury exists to **enable continuity**.

Zipvilization is built on two foundational assumptions:

1. **Minimal initial economic investment**  
   (aside from the incalculable development effort already made)
2. **Near-free access** for early colonists

This design maximizes participation,
but it also means the system must generate its own resources to evolve.

The treasury is that mechanism.

---

### What the Treasury Is Used For

The treasury may be used for:
- infrastructure (servers, tooling, software)
- external services required for development
- audits, reviews, or third-party support
- long-term maintenance of the ecosystem

The treasury does **not** exist to enrich the core team.

---

### No Privileged Position

The **factor humano (human factor)** has:
- no financial privilege
- no speculative advantage
- no special extraction rights

The core team:
- does not receive a salary
- does not receive preferential token treatment
- operates under the same on-chain rules as any other participant

Any external contributor:
- is not part of the core
- is compensated transparently if needed
- does not alter the canonical posture of Zipvilization

---

### Community Participation

Zipvilization expects — and welcomes — community involvement:

- bug discovery
- design feedback
- conceptual criticism
- structural proposals

All contributions are evaluated against **canonical pillars**.
Nothing overrides them.

---

## 🔒 Liquidity Lock

Liquidity is treated as a **structural asset**, not as a speculative signal.

Zipvilization commits to:
- creating the initial liquidity pool publicly
- ensuring liquidity cannot be removed arbitrarily
- making all liquidity-related decisions observable and documented

---

### ⏳ Lock Period Considerations

The exact duration of the liquidity lock is **under active evaluation**.

Multiple scenarios are considered, including long-term locks.
However, Zipvilization explicitly acknowledges that:

- blockchain environments evolve quickly
- liquidity dynamics can change
- excessive rigidity can harm the system

For this reason, liquidity lock duration is **not defined dogmatically**.

---

### 🎯 Guiding Principle

Any liquidity lock decision follows one rule:

> **Liquidity management must always aim to improve Solum’s liquidity  
> and benefit long-term holders.**

No liquidity decision will:
- be hidden
- be executed without prior documentation
- be justified after the fact

---

### 📖 Transparency Commitment

All liquidity-related decisions:
- are documented in this repository
- include rationale and expected impact
- are exposed **before execution**

Honesty takes precedence over false certainty.

Liquidity exists to support the system,
not to signal virtue.

---

## 🔐 Ownership & Control

### Ownership Posture

The owner role exists **only** to:
- execute predefined actions
- respect canonical constraints
- act as a steward, not a controller

Ownership is not authority.
It is responsibility.

---

### Multisignature & Safeguards

Post-launch, Zipvilization evaluates:
- multisignature ownership models
- time-locked actions
- operational separation of concerns

Any such mechanism:
- will be documented here
- will be introduced transparently
- will never bypass canonical constraints

---

## 📜 Commitment to Auditability

Zipvilization assumes scrutiny.

Therefore:
- all guarantees are written
- all changes are documented
- all decisions are exposed

There are no emergency narratives.
There are no silent pivots.

If something changes,
the reason is written here.

---

## 🧭 Final Note

Zipvilization does not promise safety.
It promises **clarity**.

It does not promise outcomes.
It promises **coherence**.

Post-launch behavior is not improvised.
It is constrained, visible, and accountable.

This document is not a shield.

It is a record.
