# 🧠 Assumptions — Explicit System Premises

This document lists the **explicit assumptions** under which Zipvilization
exists and operates.

These assumptions are not promises.
They are not guarantees.
They are not optimizations.

They are conditions.

---

## 🎯 Why Assumptions Matter

Every system operates under assumptions.

Most projects leave them implicit.
Zipvilization makes them explicit.

If an assumption fails, the system may fail economically —
but remain conceptually valid.

---

## 🧩 Core Assumptions

### 1. Blockchain as Neutral Substrate
Zipvilization assumes:
- the blockchain executes deterministically
- transactions are final once confirmed
- data is publicly accessible

It does not assume permanence of any specific chain dominance,
only functional continuity during observation.

---

### 2. Market Activity Exists
Zipvilization assumes:
- speculation exists
- volatility exists
- capital enters and exits freely

Without activity, there is no data.
Without data, there is no world.

---

### 3. Participants Are Not Rational
Zipvilization does NOT assume rational actors.

Participants may act:
- emotionally
- speculatively
- randomly
- strategically
- irrationally

All behaviors are valid inputs.

---

### 4. No Moral Interpretation
The system assumes:
- no action is “good” or “bad”
- behavior has consequences, not meaning

Meaning is layered above execution, never enforced by it.

---

### 5. Failure Is Possible
Zipvilization explicitly assumes that:
- the token may fail economically
- interest may decay
- participation may stagnate

These outcomes do not invalidate the experiment.

---

## 🚫 Assumptions Explicitly NOT Made

Zipvilization does NOT assume:
- user goodwill
- long-term holding behavior
- community coordination
- narrative alignment
- growth over time
- fair distribution

None of these are required for validity.

---

## 🧪 Assumptions vs Guarantees

Zipvilization provides **rules**, not guarantees.

If assumptions hold, observation is meaningful.
If assumptions break, observation is still possible.

The system does not correct itself.

---

## 🧠 Relationship to the Trinomial Model

- Human factor: defines initial intent and rules
- AI factor: maintains coherence and interpretation
- Horizon: accepts uncertainty beyond assumptions

Assumptions anchor the present.
The horizon remains open.

---

## ⚠️ Final Statement

Participation implies acceptance of these assumptions.

If any assumption is unacceptable,
the system is not suitable for that participant.

Zipvilization does not adapt to assumptions.
It exposes them.
