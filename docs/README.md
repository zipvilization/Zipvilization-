# 📚 Documentation

This documentation is organized around **two complementary dimensions**:

- 🧱 **Blocks** → what exists
- ⏳ **Chapters** → when it unfolds

Use this page as the **single entry point** into Zipvilization’s documentation.

## 🧱 Canonical Blocks

### 🔒 Block 0 — Solum  
**Immutable Substrate**

Solum is the on-chain foundation: contract rules, taxes, limits, and launch discipline.

➡️ See: `docs/solum/README.md`

---

### 🛠️ Block 1 — Solumtools  
**Interpretation Tools**

Solumtools translate contract and market activity into interpretable signals and interfaces.

➡️ See: `docs/solumtools/README.md`

---

### 🌍 Block 2 — Solumworld  
**World Layer**

Solumworld turns interpreted signals into a coherent, readable system over time.

➡️ See: `docs/solumworld/README.md`

---

### 🎨 Block 3 — Solumview  
**Visual Canon**

Solumview defines the visual and UI language used to make Zipvilization perceptible.

➡️ See: `docs/solumview/README.md`

## ⏳ Chapters (Roadmap)

Zipvilization unfolds in **chapters**.

Chapters are **not promises**.  
They describe *when* certain layers become observable.

---

### 🧬 Chapter 0 — Genesis  
*(Current state)*

- No canonical on-chain deployment  
- Code exists as experimentation  
- Documentation defines scope and constraints  
- Coherence before execution  

---

### 🚪 Chapter 1 — Colonization

- Liquidity pool is created  
- Solum becomes accessible to colonists (holders)  
- Transfers, accumulation, and movement begin  
- Territory exists but is not yet visible  

---

### 📊 Chapter 2 — Solumtools

- Contract and market data become observable  
- Signals are interpreted and exposed  
- Colonists can begin to see their territory  

---

### 🌐 Chapter 3 — Solumworld

- Interpreted data forms a coherent world layer  
- History, state, and evolution become readable  

---

### 🖼️ Chapter 4 — Solumview

- The world is expressed visually  
- 16-bit language reinforces the sense of place  
- Territory and activity become perceptible  

---

### 🌱 Chapter 5 — Beyond

- Interaction layers may emerge  
- Wallets may become interfaces  
- New forms of participation may appear  

This chapter remains intentionally open.

## 📐 Documentation Rules

- One source of truth per topic  
- Avoid duplication across blocks  
- Blocks explain **what exists**  
- Chapters explain **when it appears**
