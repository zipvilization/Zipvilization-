# 👁️ SolumView — Perception & Interface Layer

**SolumView is how the world is seen.**

It does not define rules.  
It does not compute states.  
It does not interpret meaning.

SolumView turns an already coherent world into something **humans can explore**.

## 🎨 What SolumView Is

SolumView is the **visual and interaction layer** of Zipvilization.

Its responsibility is to:
- render the current world state
- allow navigation and inspection
- expose time, scale, and ownership
- make complexity understandable without explanation

SolumView answers one question:

> “What does the world look like to me right now?”

## 🔍 What Users See

Through SolumView, users can:

- 🌍 Observe the world at multiple **zoom levels**
- 🧭 Navigate geography and territory
- 🏠 Inspect any visible territory
- 👤 View colonists and their land
- ⏳ Move through time and history
- 🔎 Search wallets or connect their own

Everything visible corresponds to a **real state**.

---

## 🔎 Zoom as Meaning

Zoom is not just scale.  
Zoom is **context**.

Typical zoom levels:
- **Global** → total world state
- **Regional** → clusters and frontier
- **Local** → individual territories
- **Parcel** → single wallet view

Each zoom exposes only what is meaningful at that level.

No clutter.  
No hidden mechanics.

---

## ⏱️ Time Navigation

SolumView allows users to:
- view the present
- rewind to past states
- observe evolution

Time controls never alter data.
They only change **which snapshot is shown**.

The past is read-only.  
The present is live.

---

## 👛 Wallet Mode

SolumView supports **wallet-centric exploration**:

- search any wallet
- inspect territory size and history
- classify observable roles
- connect a wallet to personalize view

Connecting a wallet:
- does not grant power
- does not unlock privileges
- only centers perspective

Ownership is visibility, not authority.

---

## 🧩 Visual Language

In SolumView:
- land size reflects token balance
- permanence reflects burn
- age reflects holding duration
- activity reflects movement history

Visuals are symbolic but deterministic.

Nothing is decorative without meaning.

---

## 🧠 Relationship to Other Layers

- **SolumWorld** defines what exists
- **SolumView** defines how it appears

SolumView never invents data.
It only renders what is already true.

---

## 🚫 What SolumView Is NOT

SolumView is not:
- a trading interface
- a strategy game
- a governance panel
- a prediction engine

It does not recommend actions.
It does not optimize outcomes.

It shows reality.

---

## 🧠 Core Principle

> A civilization becomes understandable  
> when its reality can be seen without explanation.

SolumView exists to make Zipvilization **legible to humans**.
