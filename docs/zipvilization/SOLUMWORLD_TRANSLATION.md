# 🌍 SolumWorld — World Logic & Coherence

**SolumWorld is where signals become a world.**

It does not invent data.  
It does not render visuals.  
It does not simulate strategy.

SolumWorld takes verified signals and organizes them into a **consistent, evolving reality**.

---

## 🧱 What SolumWorld Is

SolumWorld is the **world-state layer** of Zipvilization.

Its role is to:
- define what the world *is* at any moment
- ensure internal coherence across time
- apply invariant rules consistently
- expose stable states for visualization

SolumWorld answers one question:

> “Given everything that has happened, what does the world look like now?”

---

## 🔄 From Signals to States

SolumWorld consumes:
- supply and burn data
- wallet distributions
- pool interactions
- historical activity

From these, it derives **world states**, such as:
- current geography
- occupied vs permanent land
- frontier availability
- age and persistence of territories

Nothing here is speculative.  
Everything is derived.

---

## 🗺️ Geography as Logic

In SolumWorld:

- **Genesis supply** defines total possible world area
- **Active supply** defines inhabitable land
- **Burned supply** defines permanent geography

Burned land is not “gone”.
It becomes **irreversible terrain**.

This gives the world:
- memory
- irreversibility
- consequence

---

## ⏳ Time as a First-Class Dimension

SolumWorld treats time explicitly:

- states are timestamped
- transitions are recorded
- past states remain accessible

This enables:
- historical views
- evolution tracking
- aging of territories
- irreversible milestones

The world does not reset.  
It accumulates history.

---

## 🔐 Invariants & Stability

SolumWorld enforces **world invariants**:

- total geography never exceeds genesis
- burned land never returns
- territory ownership is exclusive
- transitions are deterministic

If a state violates an invariant, it is invalid.

This guarantees:
- consistency
- auditability
- trust in representation

---

## 🔁 State Transitions

World change happens only through **defined transitions**:
- transfers
- burns
- pool interactions
- time progression

Each transition:
- has a clear cause
- produces a deterministic outcome
- is recorded in history

There are no hidden jumps.

---

## 🧠 Relationship to Other Layers

- **Solum** provides immutable rules
- **Solumtools** extracts raw signals
- **SolumWorld** structures reality
- **SolumView** renders perception

SolumWorld is the **source of truth for “what exists”**.

---

## 👁️ What Users Experience

Through SolumWorld, users can perceive:
- a stable world map
- territories with history
- irreversible geography
- meaningful change over time

Even if they never see the rules,
they experience their effects.

---

## 🚫 What SolumWorld Is NOT

SolumWorld does not:
- decide outcomes
- optimize strategies
- create narratives
- judge actions

It does not play the world.  
It **holds** the world.

---

## 🧠 Core Principle

> A world is not defined by graphics,  
> but by rules that never contradict themselves.

SolumWorld exists to make Zipvilization **coherent**.
