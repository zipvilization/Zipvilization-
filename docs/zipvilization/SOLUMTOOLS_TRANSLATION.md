# 🧱 Solum — Territory Substrate

**Solum is the physical substrate of Zipvilization.**

It exists on-chain as a fixed-supply token.  
In Zipvilization, it exists as **land**.

---

## 🌱 From Token to Territory

The translation rule is simple and immutable:

> **1 Solum = 1 square meter (1 m²)**

This rule never changes.

- Total Solum supply defines the **maximum possible world size**
- Wallet balances define **owned territory**
- Burned Solum defines **permanent geography**

Nothing is symbolic.  
Nothing is adjustable.

## 🗺️ World Size & Permanence

### 🌍 Genesis World
At deployment, Solum defines a fixed maximum world:

- **Genesis Supply** → Total possible land (m²)
- This value is constant and known from day one

This is the *planetary boundary* of Zipvilization.

---

### 🔥 Burned Territory (Permanent Geography)

When Solum is burned on-chain:

- Total supply decreases
- That land **does not disappear**
- It becomes **permanent geography**

In Zipvilization, burned Solum is interpreted as:
- forests
- rivers
- lakes
- mountains
- non-colonizable land

Burn is not loss.  
Burn is **world formation**.

---

## 🧑‍🌾 Colonists & Ownership

Every wallet holding Solum is a **colonist**.

For any wallet:
- Solum balance → owned territory (m²)
- Time held → age of territory
- Movement → migration or redistribution

There is no registration.  
There is no identity layer.

Ownership is **purely on-chain**.

---

## 📐 Limits & Natural Constraints

Solum enforces limits at the contract level:
- maximum transaction size
- maximum wallet size (dynamic over time)

In Zipvilization, these appear as:
- natural expansion limits
- early scarcity
- gradual opening of space over time

Limits are not rules imposed by Zipvilization.  
They are **physical laws of the world**.

---

## ⏳ Time as a First-Class Dimension

Solum does not reset.

Every action accumulates:
- territory changes
- permanent geography
- historical state

Zipvilization reads Solum as a **timeline**, not a snapshot.

What exists now is the result of everything that happened before.

---

## 🚫 What Solum Does NOT Mean

Solum is **not**:
- points
- score
- power
- rank
- governance weight

Solum is **space**.

What you do with space is interpreted one layer above.

---

## 🔗 Relationship to Other Layers

- **Solumtools** reads Solum and extracts signals
- **SolumWorld** organizes Solum into maps and states
- **SolumView** renders Solum as something you can see and explore

Solum itself never changes meaning.

---

## 🧠 Core Principle

> If land is real, it must be finite.

Solum defines that finiteness.  
Zipvilization makes it visible.
