# 🔍 Solumtools — Observation & Signals

**Solumtools is how Zipvilization sees.**

It does not act.  
It does not decide.  
It does not simulate.

Solumtools observes the blockchain and extracts **verifiable signals** that Zipvilization can later interpret.

---

## 👁️ From On-chain Data to Visibility

Solumtools reads only public, verifiable sources:

- Solum smart contract
- Solum liquidity pool
- Transaction history
- Chain time and blocks

From these, it produces **signals** — not opinions.

In Zipvilization, those signals become **what the user can inspect**.

---

## 🧭 What Users Can See

Through Solumtools, the interface can expose:

### 🌍 Global Signals
- Total world size (genesis supply)
- Active territory (current supply)
- Permanent geography (burned supply)
- Protocol state (trading enabled, limits active)

These are shown as **world-level indicators**, not metrics to optimize.

---

### 🧑‍🌾 Colonist (Wallet) Inspection

For any wallet, users can inspect:

- Owned territory (m²)
- Territory history over time
- First appearance in the system
- Activity footprint (movement, inactivity)
- Interaction with the frontier (pool)

No wallet is hidden.  
No view is privileged.

---

### 🗺️ Territory Distribution

Solumtools enables views such as:
- largest landholders
- long-standing territories
- untouched (virgin) land
- highly active zones

These are **classifications**, not rankings.

They describe *what exists*, not *what should be*.

---

## 🧠 Roles as Footprints (Not Labels)

Solumtools may classify observable roles based on behavior:

- early colonists
- inactive territories
- frequent movers
- major landholders
- fertility contributors (burn / reflection paths)

Important:
- Roles are **descriptive**
- A colonist can have multiple roles
- Roles change over time

Zipvilization interprets roles visually.  
Solumtools only reports them.

---

## 📈 Time & History

Solumtools tracks **history**, not just state:

- when territory was acquired
- how it changed
- how long it persisted
- how it interacted with the system

This enables Zipvilization to show:
- evolution
- aging
- stability
- transformation

---

## 🚫 What Solumtools Never Does

Solumtools does **not**:
- predict outcomes
- recommend actions
- assign value judgments
- hide or prioritize wallets
- simulate alternate futures

It is not a game system.  
It is an observation layer.

---

## 🔗 Relationship to Other Layers

- **Solum** defines the substrate
- **Solumtools** extracts signals
- **SolumWorld** organizes signals into states
- **SolumView** renders them visually

Solumtools is the **lens**, not the world.

---

## 🧠 Core Principle

> If something cannot be verified on-chain, it does not exist here.

Solumtools makes the system **legible**,  
so Zipvilization can make it **comprehensible**.
