# Zip Biology Timing  
**Territory Consolidation & Reproductive Activation**

This document defines the **canonical biological timing model** of Zipvilization.

It explains how Zip reproduction is activated, delayed, and consolidated
based on **territory level**, **time**, and **territorial stability**.

Biology does not drive territory.  
Territory drives biology.

---

## 1. Core Principle

Every territory contains **latent reproductive potential**.

That potential:
- exists immediately when a territory level is reached
- activates only when lower levels are mature
- requires time to consolidate
- can be interrupted if the territory level is lost

Biology is **latent by default**, and **activated by consolidation**.

---

## 2. Latent Reproductive Pairs by Territory Level

Each territory level contains a fixed number of **latent reproductive pairs**.

Farm: 1  
Village: 10  
City: 100  
County: 1,000  
State: 5,000  
Kingdom: 25,000  

Latent pairs:
- do not reproduce immediately
- do not generate population
- become active only when their activation conditions are met

---

## 3. Activation Rules

### 3.1 Farm (Base Unit)

- A farm activates **immediately** upon creation.
- Activation delay: **3 days**
- After activation, the pair begins reproduction.

A farm reaches biological maturity when:
- its maximum Zip population is reached
- reproduction cycles have stabilized

Canonical farm maturity time: **~16 days**

---

### 3.2 Village

A village contains **10 latent reproductive pairs**.

Activation conditions:
- All underlying farms must be **biologically mature**
- After farm maturity:
  - Village latent pairs begin gestation
  - Gestation delay: **3 days**

Village reproduction therefore starts at:

Farm maturity (≈16 days)  
+ Village gestation (3 days)  
= ≈19 days

---

### 3.3 Higher Territories

The same rule applies recursively:

City: All villages mature + 3 days  
County: All cities mature + 3 days  
State: All counties mature + 3 days  
Kingdom: All states mature + 3 days  

Each level:
- waits for the **full consolidation** of the level below
- then activates its own latent pairs after gestation

---

## 4. Consolidated Core

A territory is considered **consolidated** when:
- its territory level is stable
- all latent pairs for that level are active
- maximum population for that level is reached
- minor Solum fluctuations do not downgrade the territory

This state is called a **Consolidated Core**.

---

## 5. Territory Loss & Biological Collapse

If a territory loses its category due to Solum reduction:
- its latent pairs **do not die**
- their activation is **halted**
- higher-level biology becomes inactive
- the system collapses gracefully to the lower level

---

## 6. Time as Stabilizer

Time is the **only stabilizer** of territory.

Fast accumulation does not guarantee consolidation.  
Holding enables activation and stabilization.

---

## 7. Blockchain Alignment

Timing is expressed in **days** for conceptual clarity.

In implementation:
- days translate to **block intervals**
- timing remains deterministic and verifiable

---

## 8. Canonical Summary

Territory defines biological potential.  
Biology activates through consolidation.  
Consolidation requires time.  
Time creates stability.

A territory is not what it claims to be.  
It is what it has managed to sustain.
