# 🌍 Zipvilization

**Zipvilization is a readable civilization built on public on-chain data.**

It is not a game.  
It is not a financial dashboard.  
It is not a simulation with hidden rules.

Zipvilization exists to make an on-chain system **visible, explorable, and understandable** as territory, history, and structure.

## 🧭 What You See in Zipvilization

When you enter Zipvilization, you interact with:

- 🌱 **Territory** — land measured in square meters
- 👤 **Colonists** — wallets represented as inhabitants
- 🗺️ **World views** — maps at different levels of scale
- ⏳ **History** — how the world has evolved from genesis to now
- 🔍 **Observation tools** — inspect any visible territory or wallet

Everything you see is derived from **public blockchain data**.  
Nothing is hidden. Nothing is invented.

## 🧩 How Zipvilization Is Built

Zipvilization is composed of several technical layers.  
Each layer has a **clear responsibility**, and each one is reflected in what you see.

This folder (`docs/zipvilization/`) explains **how those layers appear in the frontend**.

| Technical Layer | What it does | What you see |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Solum** | On-chain substrate | Territory size, limits, permanence |
| **Solumtools** | Data interpretation | Metrics, roles, visibility |
| **SolumWorld** | World logic | Maps, zooms, states, evolution |
| **SolumView** | Visual expression | UI, timelines, wallet mode |

This documentation does not redefine those systems.  
It explains **how they manifest to the user**.

## 👁️ Transparency by Design

Zipvilization is fully observable:

- Any wallet can be inspected
- Any territory can be explored
- Any historical state can be reviewed
- Any visible metric can be traced to its on-chain origin

There are:
- ❌ No private dashboards  
- ❌ No hidden modifiers  
- ❌ No narrative filters  

What you see is what exists.

## 🚫 What Zipvilization Is Not

Zipvilization does **not**:

- Provide financial advice
- Recommend actions
- Predict prices or outcomes
- Judge behavior as good or bad
- Gamify participation

Zipvilization observes.  
Meaning emerges from structure and time.

## 📂 How to Read This Documentation

This folder contains **frontend-oriented translations** of the technical system:

- `SOLUM_TRANSLATION.md`  
  → What territory represents in the interface

- `SOLUMTOOLS_TRANSLATION.md`  
  → How metrics, roles, and observations appear

- `SOLUMWORLD_TRANSLATION.md`  
  → How the world is structured across space and time

- `SOLUMVIEW_TRANSLATION.md`  
  → How everything is rendered and navigated

If you want to inspect the underlying mechanics, refer to the technical folders.  
If you want to understand **what you are seeing**, start here.

## 🧠 Core Principle

> If a civilization is real, it must be observable.

Zipvilization does not explain the world.  
It lets the world **show itself**.
