# 🌍 SolumWorld
### Civilizational Interpretation Layer

SolumWorld is the **civilizational interpretation layer** built on top of Solum.

It explores how persistent on-chain state, when observed over time,  
can be interpreted as structures resembling settlement, growth,  
organization, and collapse.

> SolumWorld interprets.  
> It does not simulate.  
> It does not intervene.

## 🧠 What SolumWorld Is

SolumWorld is:

- a conceptual layer derived from Solum state  
- an interpretive framework for long-term patterns  
- a non-interactive reading of persistence  
- a bridge between raw execution and systemic meaning  

SolumWorld **observes structure**.  
It does not generate it.

---

## 🚫 What SolumWorld Is Not

SolumWorld is **not**:

- a game world  
- a metaverse  
- a simulation with actors or decisions  
- a governance system  
- a promise of future functionality  

Any interpretation that treats SolumWorld as interactive or playable  
is incorrect.

---

## 🔗 Relationship to Other Blocks

SolumWorld exists **after** Solumtools.

- **Solum** → defines persistence and erosion  
- **Solumtools** → structures observable signals  
- **SolumWorld** → interprets resulting patterns  

SolumWorld reads what is already true.  
It does not add new truth.

## 🔍 Zoom Levels
### Zoom as Temporal Orientation

Zoom is **not proximity**.  
Zoom is a change in **temporal interpretation density**.

Zoom does not move closer to territory.  
It moves closer to **accumulated history**.

> Zoom is always centripetal,  
> oriented toward the temporal origin of the system.

---

### 🔹 Zoom 0 — Global State

- fully aggregated system state  
- no historical detail  
- statistical distribution only  

---

### 🔹 Zoom 1 — Regional Distribution

- regional patterns emerge  
- relative age becomes visible  
- no ownership detail  

---

### 🔹 Zoom 2 — Density Patterns

- clusters and corridors  
- persistence vs volatility  
- structural tendencies appear  

---

### 🔹 Zoom 3 — Historical Accumulation

- long-lived regions  
- stable vs unstable zones  
- history becomes legible

## ⚖️ Non-Intervention Rule

SolumWorld has **no authority**.

It does not:
- control Solum  
- alter execution  
- recommend actions  
- optimize outcomes  

It exposes structure.  
Nothing more.

---

## 🧭 Scope

SolumWorld explains:

- how to read patterns  
- how scale alters meaning  
- how persistence shapes structure  

It does **not** define:

- interfaces  
- narratives  
- economic promises  

Those belong to other layers.
