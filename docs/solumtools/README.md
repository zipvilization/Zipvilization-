# 🛠️ Solumtools
**Interpretation Layer**

Solumtools is the technical interface between the Solum contract
and the Zipvilization universe.

It does not change execution.  
It does not optimize outcomes.  
It does not predict behavior.

Solumtools **reads**, **structures**, and **exposes** what already happened on-chain.

---

## 🔍 What Solumtools Is

Solumtools is a data interpretation layer.

Its role is to:
- observe Solum execution
- extract relevant signals
- translate raw blockchain data into meaningful structures

It is not a trading tool in the traditional sense.
It is not a dashboard for speculation.

It is the **lens** through which Zipvilization becomes readable.

---

## 🔗 Source of Truth

Solumtools has a single source of truth:

> **The Solum contract execution**

All data originates from:
- transfers
- burns
- reflections
- liquidity events
- treasury accumulation

If it did not happen on-chain,  
Solumtools does not invent it.

---

## 🧩 What Solumtools Interprets

Solumtools translates execution into structured signals such as:

- circulating supply
- burned supply
- holder distribution
- liquidity depth
- treasury growth
- transfer density
- temporal activity

These signals are **descriptive**, not prescriptive.

They describe *what is*, not *what should be*.

---

## 🌍 From Token to Territory

In Zipvilization, Solumtools performs a conceptual translation:

- **Token balance** → territory size
- **Holding time** → settlement stability
- **Burn events** → fertility signals
- **Liquidity depth** → ground stability
- **Treasury growth** → evolution capacity

Nothing is added.
Nothing is hidden.

Meaning is derived from execution.

---

## 🧠 Interpretation, Not Control

Solumtools has no authority.

It cannot:
- pause the contract
- alter rules
- block actions
- trigger upgrades

If the system collapses,
Solumtools records the collapse.

If the system grows,
Solumtools records the growth.

This non-intervention is intentional.

---

## 📊 Outputs and Surfaces

Solumtools may expose its interpretations through:

- APIs
- metrics endpoints
- datasets
- analytical views

These outputs are designed to be:
- human-readable
- machine-readable
- auditable
- reproducible

Solumtools is built to be consumed by:
- interfaces
- visual layers
- external tools
- autonomous agents

---

## ⚖️ Neutrality by Design

Solumtools does not judge behavior.

Speculation, holding, trading, inactivity —
all are valid actions.

Solumtools does not moralize outcomes.
It makes them legible.

---

## 🧭 Relationship to Other Layers

- **Solum** defines immutable rules
- **Solumtools** interprets execution
- **Solumworld** expresses state
- **Solumview** renders experience

Each layer has a single responsibility.

## 📂 Subdocs (to be added)

- `metrics.md`
- `data-sources.md`
- `signals.md`
- `interpretation-rules.md`

One interpretation.  
One reality.
