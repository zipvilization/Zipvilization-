# 🛠️ Solumtools  
**On-chain Signals → Readable Reality**

Solumtools is the **interpretation layer** of Solum.

It does not change the blockchain.  
It does not control behavior.  
It does not hide information.

Solumtools exists to **observe**, **extract**, and **translate** on-chain activity into a form that can later be understood as territory, participation, and history.

## 🌱 What Solumtools Is

Solumtools is a set of tools and definitions that:

- Read **public on-chain data** from the Solum contract and its market interface
- Extract **structural signals** (supply, movement, limits, fees, treasury flows)
- Normalize those signals into **coherent, deterministic states**
- Prepare the data for its interpretative mirrors in **SolumWorld** and **SolumView**

Solumtools is not narrative.  
It is **pre-narrative**.

---

## 🔍 What Solumtools Does

Solumtools focuses on **visibility and structure**, not judgment.

It enables:

- 📊 Observation of **any wallet / territory**
- 🔎 Search and inspection of **any colonist**
- 📐 Measurement of territory size, age, and activity
- ⏳ Tracking of historical evolution over time
- 🧱 Classification of roles based on **verifiable behavioral signals**

Everything Solumtools reads is already public on-chain.  
Solumtools only makes it **legible**.

---

## 🧭 Roles Without Judgment

Solumtools does not define *good* or *bad* actors.

Every on-chain action has a **function** within the system.

Examples of observable roles:
- Veteran colonists (early or persistent holders)
- Virgin territories (untouched land)
- Highly active territories
- Major landholders
- Contributors to burn, liquidity, or reflection dynamics

All roles coexist.  
All contribute to the system’s evolution.

---

## 🌍 Open World by Design

Solumtools is **open by default**:

- Any wallet can be observed
- Any territory can be inspected
- No private views
- No hidden dashboards

Transparency is not a feature.  
It is the foundation.

---

## 🚫 What Solumtools Is NOT

Solumtools is **not**:

- A game
- A strategy interface
- A financial trading dashboard
- A governance system
- A simulation of Zipvilization itself

It does not render the world.  
It does not assign meaning.

That happens **one layer above**.

---

## 🔗 Relationship to Zipvilization

Solumtools has two canonical mirrors:

- **SolumWorld** — where signals become a coherent, rule-bound world state  
- **SolumView** — where that world is expressed visually and temporally  

In this process:
- Wallets become **territories**
- Holders become **colonists**
- On-chain mechanics acquire **physical meaning**

---

## 📐 Technical Grounding

Solumtools is grounded entirely in **verifiable on-chain data**.

All extracted signals derive from:
- Fixed supply and real burn mechanics
- Liquidity pool state
- Treasury inflows
- Reflection dynamics
- Transaction and wallet constraints
- Historical transaction logs

If a signal cannot be derived on-chain, it does not exist in Solumtools.

---

## 🧱 Position in the System

Solumtools sits **between**:

- 🔒 **Solum** — immutable on-chain substrate  
- 🌍 **SolumWorld** — canonical world/state layer  
- 🎨 **SolumView** — visual and temporal expression  

It does not decide meaning.  
It makes meaning **possible**.

---

## 🧠 Core Principle

Solumtools assumes one thing:

> If a civilization is real, it must be observable.

No filters.  
No shortcuts.  
No moral layers.

Only signals, structure, and time.
