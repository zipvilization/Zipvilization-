# 🛠️ Solumtools  
**On-chain Signals → Readable Reality**

Solumtools is the **interpretation layer** of Solum.

It does not change the blockchain.  
It does not control behavior.  
It does not hide information.

Solumtools exists to **observe**, **extract**, and **translate** on-chain activity into a form that can later be understood as territory, participation, and history.

## 🌱 What Solumtools Is

Solumtools is a set of tools and definitions that:

- Read **public on-chain data** from the Solum contract
- Extract **structural signals** (supply, movement, limits, taxes, treasury)
- Organize those signals into **coherent, interpretable states**
- Prepare the data for its interpretative mirror inside **Zipvilization**

Solumtools is not narrative.  
It is **pre-narrative**.

---

## 🔍 What Solumtools Does

Solumtools focuses on **visibility and structure**, not judgment.

It enables:

- 📊 Observation of **all wallets / territories**
- 🔎 Search and inspection of **any colonist (holder)**
- 📐 Measurement of territory size, age, and activity
- ⏳ Tracking of historical evolution over time
- 🧱 Classification of roles based on **behavioral signals**, never intent

Everything Solumtools reads is already public on-chain.  
Solumtools only makes it **legible**.

---

## 🧭 Roles Without Judgment

Solumtools does not define *good* or *bad* actors.

Every action has a **function**.

Examples of observable roles:
- Long-standing colonists (early or persistent holders)
- Inactive territories (virgin land, untouched)
- Highly active territories (frequent transfers)
- Large landholders
- Contributors to fertility (burn) and reflection dynamics

All roles coexist.  
All contribute to the system’s evolution.

## 🌍 Open World by Design

Solumtools is **open to the world**:

- Any wallet can be observed
- Any territory can be inspected
- No private views
- No hidden dashboards

Transparency is not a feature.  
It is the foundation.

---

## 🚫 What Solumtools Is NOT

Solumtools is **not**:

- A game
- A strategy interface
- A financial trading dashboard
- A governance system
- A simulation of Zipvilization itself

It does not render the world.  
It does not add meaning.

That happens **one layer above**.

---

## 🔗 Relationship to Zipvilization

Solumtools has a direct interpretative mirror inside Zipvilization.

In Zipvilization:
- Wallets become **territories**
- Holders become **colonists**
- On-chain mechanics acquire **physical meaning**

---

## 📐 Technical Specification

Solumtools is grounded entirely in the Solum smart contract.

All extracted signals are derived from:
- Fixed supply
- Burn mechanics
- Liquidity pool state
- Treasury flows
- Reflection dynamics
- Transaction and wallet limits

---

## 🧱 Position in the System

Solumtools sits **between**:

- 🔒 **Solum** — immutable on-chain substrate  
- 🌍 **Solumworld** — coherent world layer  
- 🎨 **Solumview** — visual and temporal expression  

It does not decide meaning.  
It makes meaning **possible**.

---

## 🧠 Core Principle

Solumtools assumes one thing:

> If a civilization is real, it must be observable.

No filters.  
No shortcuts.  
No moral layers.

Only signals, structure, and time.
